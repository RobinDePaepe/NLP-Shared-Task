Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ?To begin with, I surley accomodate this, and it is more influencial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, for example: what would it be better if a student knows that the sea is deep, or learns why its deep, that will give student a deeper, wider, and a variety of ways to think, students will be more efficient in their life,thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future, and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way.In the past, people had limited recources, no computers, no television, and it would be good if they had books with a quite limited explanation, so our past ansistors depended on their logic, religon, and the scenario that they pass through everyday to learn facts, which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays, inventions and innovations passed through, so what is left?Its more important to understand ideas and concepts, as I have mentioned that all facts have been produced, so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in ideas and concepts and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day, because one day he will be tested with the facts in front of him. Example: in a math exam a student gets all rules that he might need to solve the qustion, but what he needs is the concept of how to solve the question.It is not a mirracle for a student to pass his study life with flying coulors, every person owns his own mind, but the secret of each is where when and how to use it. which will result him in his/her desired outcome.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success. When defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal. To simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself.To find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs. For one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings. This gives him the offset of a \"jack of all trades\". He chooses to experiance all but master nothing. And as such he also finds adversity in the decisions he chose to define himself as. One would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona, but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle.Accordingly so, others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull. It is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful. Knowing ones faults and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life. But might also negatively affect a persons weaknesses when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about.In conclusion, any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one. It is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is. Knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman. It is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals. Therefore it is goals which define success, and it is only obtaining those goals that should consequently matter.</td>\n",

But the fact that know body ever fully got to that point, can bring doubts on the possibility of this issue. For some people knowing everything is what they live for. For others limitation to one academic subject is preferable.On one hand, some people, might get stubborn, and look forword to pass their life trying to answer their never ending questions.They get to a certain point, where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know, because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything. Consequently, they will continue their never ending researches, and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection.On the other hand, other people, find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely. Rather, then wasting time trying to learn about many academics, they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely. This part of the population, will be able to invest its life to its full, because they will not have to live anxiety, they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life. They will, furthermore by having this sense of proudness, be more confident in themselves then a person that works extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he/ she has accomplished.In conclusion, knowing everything, can not be reachable, at least not for the moment. Life is too short we better live it to its full, and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memories to remember in the futur.</td>\n",

       "1  Nowadays, knowledge has changed, methods of approach are different, concepts has become more difficut to master, students have different abilities, there are students with limited abilites and stretched to students with overwhelming abilities, this does not put an end to learning experience, as there is a question that is floating  in our minds and leads a person to a deeper thinking and makes him put his knowlege behind him. Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ?To begin with, I surley accomodate this, and it is more influencial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, for example: what would it be better if a student knows that the sea is deep, or learns why its deep, that will give student a deeper, wider, and a variety of ways to think, students will be more efficient in their life,thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future, and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way.In the past, people had limited recources, no computers, no television, and it would be good if they had books with a quite limited explanation, so our past ansistors depended on their logic, religon, and the scenario that they pass through everyday to learn facts, which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays, inventions and innovations passed through, so what is left?Its more important to understand ideas and concepts, as I have mentioned that all facts have been produced, so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in ideas and concepts and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day, because one day he will be tested with the facts in front of him. Example: in a math exam a student gets all rules that he might need to solve the qustion, but what he needs is the concept of how to solve the question.It is not a mirracle for a student to pass his study life with flying coulors, every person owns his own mind, but the secret of each is where when and how to use it. which will result him in his/her desired outcome.   \n",
       "2  When success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success. When defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal. To simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself.To find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs. For one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings. This gives him the offset of a \"jack of all trades\". He chooses to experiance all but master nothing. And as such he also finds adversity in the decisions he chose to define himself as. One would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona, but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle.Accordingly so, others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull. It is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful. Knowing ones faults and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life. But might also negatively affect a persons weaknesses when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about.In conclusion, any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one. It is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is. Knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman. It is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals. Therefore it is goals which define success, and it is only obtaining those goals that should consequently matter.                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3  Knowing everything is what makes people intellectually perfect! Every human being looks forward to this. But the fact that know body ever fully got to that point, can bring doubts on the possibility of this issue. For some people knowing everything is what they live for. For others limitation to one academic subject is preferable.On one hand, some people, might get stubborn, and look forword to pass their life trying to answer their never ending questions.They get to a certain point, where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know, because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything. Consequently, they will continue their never ending researches, and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection.On the other hand, other people, find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely. Rather, then wasting time trying to learn about many academics, they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely. This part of the population, will be able to invest its life to its full, because they will not have to live anxiety, they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life. They will, furthermore by having this sense of proudness, be more confident in themselves then a person that works extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he/ she has accomplished.In conclusion, knowing everything, can not be reachable, at least not for the moment. Life is too short we better live it to its full, and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memories to remember in the futur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "      <td>Nowadays, knowledge has changed, methods of approach are different, concepts has become more difficut to master, students have different abilities, there are students with limited abilites and stretched to students with overwhelming abilities, this does not put an end to learning experience, as there is a question that is floating  in our minds and leads a person to a deeper thinking and makes him put his knowlege behind him. Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ?To begin with, I surley accomodate this, and it is more influencial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, for example: what would it be better if a student knows that the sea is deep, or learns why its deep, that will give student a deeper, wider, and a variety of ways to think, students will be more efficient in their life,thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future, and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way.In the past, people had limited recources, no computers, no television, and it would be good if they had books with a quite limited explanation, so our past ansistors depended on their logic, religon, and the scenario that they pass through everyday to learn facts, which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays, inventions and innovations passed through, so what is left?Its more important to understand ideas and concepts, as I have mentioned that all facts have been produced, so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in ideas and concepts and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day, because one day he will be tested with the facts in front of him. Example: in a math exam a student gets all rules that he might need to solve the qustion, but what he needs is the concept of how to solve the question.It is not a mirracle for a student to pass his study life with flying coulors, every person owns his own mind, but the secret of each is where when and how to use it. which will result him in his/her desired outcome.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success. When defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal. To simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself.To find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs. For one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings. This gives him the offset of a \"jack of all trades\". He chooses to experiance all but master nothing. And as such he also finds adversity in the decisions he chose to define himself as. One would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona, but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle.Accordingly so, others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull. It is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful. Knowing ones faults and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life. But might also negatively affect a persons weaknesses when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about.In conclusion, any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one. It is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is. Knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman. It is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals. Therefore it is goals which define success, and it is only obtaining those goals that should consequently matter.</td>\n",

But the fact that know body ever fully got to that point, can bring doubts on the possibility of this issue. For some people knowing everything is what they live for. For others limitation to one academic subject is preferable.On one hand, some people, might get stubborn, and look forword to pass their life trying to answer their never ending questions.They get to a certain point, where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know, because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything. Consequently, they will continue their never ending researches, and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection.On the other hand, other people, find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely. Rather, then wasting time trying to learn about many academics, they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely. This part of the population, will be able to invest its life to its full, because they will not have to live anxiety, they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life. They will, furthermore by having this sense of proudness, be more confident in themselves then a person that works extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he/ she has accomplished.In conclusion, knowing everything, can not be reachable, at least not for the moment. Life is too short we better live it to its full, and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memories to remember in the futur.</td>\n",

He must be know which way they have to go. he must know which way is right and which way is wrong. He have to realize which road is dangures and which way is not.

       "      <td>Travling costs a lot of money. Have you ever thought about how much do you spend when you travle? A lot of people love travling but they do not want to spend a lot of money on travling. When people travled to a different place about which they do not have any information, they would get lost while they were looking for the places they wanted to visit. Therefore, having a tour guide with you in your travling can take to beautiful places in short time. There fore I agree on that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because by that, the tour guide entertained you and save your times which are the most important things during your travling. The first benefit of have a tour guide is that he entertains you. the tour guide have a big knowlagde about the place where he tours you. For example, supose you do not know about the good places in Califronia and you went to it. If you did not have a tour guide, you would not good any places except the ones that near by your hotel. In addition, if asked people about the good places, they would not tell you because they might not remeber them. However the tour guide job is to know the good places that will make the tourists entertained. Finally, the tour guide would try his hardest to entertained you, so that you might like him and tell othe pople about him. The second point is theat the tour guide would save a lot of your time. For exmample, one of my friend went to Riyadh, which is the capitel city of Soudi Arabia, with out a tour guide. He thought that since he lives in a country that is near by Saudi Arabia, he should know where to go in Riyadh. On the contrary, hey got lost in it and waste a lot of time looking for the good places and hotels to stay in. His plan eas to spend one week in Riyadh but he spent tow weeks. When I asked him about his trip, he said that he should have rented a tour guide. Eventhough, he went with a group who also have good information about Riyadh, the got lost. Opponents of having a tour guide in a group maintain that it cost money having a tour guide. However, having a tour guide would cost less on what you would spen on transportation by getting lost. In conclusion, you would save time and be entertaind if you have a tour fuide in a travle with a group.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The foremost business philosopher in America Jim Rohn said, \"To survive in the twentieth century you have to know more than one skill.\" Today, life is changing at a very high pace and more than ever before.  The computer age which revolutianized every possible aspect in the world has gotten us to what we call the age of knowledge where to specialize in one specific subject is not enough in order to fulfill one's self.  Therefore it is better and imperative that one gets specialized in more than one domain for economic reasons and personal reasons.Everyone wants to lead comfortable lives and have a safe future.  Most of us want to be rich.  To do so, nobody is going to be specialized in only one field because now, and more than ever, all fields are related to another.  For instance, let's take real estate.  An investor who wants to invest in real estate has to have an education in business, law, finance, banking, and even construction.  If this investor is only familiar in business, how can he know about taxation policies, or about which kind of construction material to choose from?  Therefore, a knowledge in more than one subject can prove a valuable asset when it comes to increasing wealth.To seek knowledge is everyone's personal ambition.  The process is tough and lifelong.  It requires a thirst for learning and a hunger to seek the many truths which our world stores.  To have knowledge in a lot of subjects is a virtue in society.  It gives reputation and instant recognition.  Take a company that wants to hire a new employee and  that has the possibility of choosing two candidates:  a person having a business degree who has worked only in one kind of firm all his life, and another holding the same degree who has worked in many differenet trends of business.  The company should choose the latter since he's been exposed to the world more than the other candidate.  Also, having an idea of a lot of subjects can be self satisfying since no one can laugh at the person or try to trick him.  The world is filled with cons and crook men.  If you're limited to only one type of education, the chances of you being cheated are very high.  Therefore having a broad knowledge in many domains can be rewarding on a personal basis.To sum up, being involved in more than one subject is much better than being only involved in one for many reasons  such as economic reasons and personal reasons.  Today the world obliges us to invest our time in education since it will affect our living conditions.  Being more knowledgeable is also rewarding in that it gives a good image and reputation and can serve as a defence against cheating.  And the most important thing is to keep learning, keep living, loving, and leaving a legacy for others to follow.</td>\n",

For example, advertisements show only the good part of a product, and their only concern is to sell the product to the consumer no matter what suits him.Advertisements only show how the product is great and wounderfull, and they even show it in a way that makes it look different. Let us take a children's gum or a lolypop for instance, in advertisments you can see two or more children grabing one of those sweets, and when they try it, their appearance and the whole world changes around them and all of it becomes like a sweet dream. Now , what kind of messege would an advertisement give to a child?  The answer is clear when you just take a look at a child in sweets section in any super market. Those children who will try the dreamy product will feel that they wear tricked, simply because they will remain in their same spot with a normal taest.Advetisements do care only about gitting bought regardless of wheather they suits the buyer or not. Let us take clothes for instance, in advertisements you can see people from different ages wearing tha same styile and the same colors and the same fit. Now, what would such an advertiement make people think is alright? The answer is also clear from what you can see in the streets of poeple wearing things that are not appropriate for thier ages.In conclusion, I agree that most advertismen</td>\n",

Although, tour guide gives more and easy information about the places, socities, people, and the history of the country that we visite, I would rather traviling alone and without tour guide.Some people may argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It is more easy to descover ; so this argument goes, the places and avoide any trubles. However, traveling is an enjoment that icloudes discovering new things and knowing different people and get in touch with different culturals. Therefore, if I travel in a group led by a tour guide, I will be controlled by the guide's directions and I wolud not be able to act and get in touch with others by my own way.Moreover, travel alone or with a good friend not with a group that I do not know provides me with a uniqe experience. For example, three years ago I traveled to the United Arab Emirates with my best friend, Jack,  . Eventhough non of us use to live or being there before, we had a very good time and experience. We rent a care from Abu Dhabi, the capital city, and we almost went every where in the country just by using the mabs and asking people in streets.In conclussion, I believe that traveling alone and without been attached to any group  gives  the most wonderful experience in the life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>King Faisal once said\" working for your country is the best way to show your belonging and caring for it\" when king Faisal became the king of Saudi Arabia he's first deed was to give people the cahnace to participate and do thier best in working to devolpe the Kimgdom of Saudi Arabia. I don't think it will be fair if we said that young people don't give enough time to helping thier communities, because if this was true there won't be amy people who will do anything to get a good aducation and defending the Kingdom.      Getting a good education is one of the reasons that will suport my point. In order to get a high level of aducation you really must work hard  which will take alot of effort and time. By mantaning a college degree the person will be able to work and make himself useful, for example my cousin is an engineer in a good company and he's making alot of money for the company, once he got a rewarde from prince Nasser for an excellent project he had acomlished.          Also we can charity as away to spend our time helping the communtie. nowdays all muslims from oll of the world  are fasting the Holy month of Ramadan. During this month alot of young people and children are encourged to spend their time doing somethings good for the comunity, Princes Joharah opened an aducational center for orphens and had invited every one. I visted this center and i have been teaching children how to read and write Arabic for the past three days. It took four hours a day but it is reallu a great experince              I think now it's abvoiusally clear why i think young people do spend alot of time helping their communtiy. However there will be alot of things that might keep us busy but we always should remind ourselves to our duties to the communitie.</td>\n",

In future i think  there wont be cars at all or at least not in this huge amount that we have it in this days, i think that the scentists will discover other ways for transportation, they would change the car using petroul by other with different shape using light or using other thing, or even future people could have a bag in their back, and whenever they want to go to some where they just press a little button and they fly  or even wearing a shoes which makes you to jump a large distance or thousand of ideas that will make us not  using the cars and the trains , which makes our atmosphere clearer and better way to live.  Alhough i think that this step will happen in future, but i dont think it will happen in near future, because this kind of step needs a plan with the risks that could be taken in such cases, with opprotunity for everyone to have this venture,</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ever since I have been introduced to the learning system in our country, I have been always faced with two approaches while learning: The American approach versus the French approach to deliver knowledge. Whereas the French system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic, the American way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic. But the question is: Which one is the best? Here lies the \"chicken first or egg first problem\".Some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject. This way, the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it.As an example, if I want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on, I would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it.While this approach is followed by many, others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts. In other words, by being exposed to facts, students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated, leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient. In other words, if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above, instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on, the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject, thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea.I emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts.I can still remember the effect's power that a fact will leave on students, at least on me when I was back at the university. I was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas.</td>\n",

I agree with the point that says advirtising is showing us that the commercial product is really needed while its not. like a commecial that we dont have to use it in your life at all couse for me, i dont have to use it.      like someone telling you that my 15 years old doughter wants to buy any product that she see in the TV to show her to her friends at school or becouse its just in the TV. And also for no reason to use it while she dont need it, she just want to buy it.      Also i agree that we sometimes need to see, read and watch about that commecial prudacts to know about things which its useful for our life while we dont know about it at all or we just dont know what is the prudact is needed for. Although they are playing with our minds by using a fake results they got or when the dont show us the bad effects of the prudact the are advertising about.      Additionally, commercial advsrtising is taking a big part of our life becouse its around us wherever we go, like in the streets while we are driving our cars, the resturants, and any place where its making an attention.       I also beleive that its also effecting our daily life becouse i could buy an advertising news paper just to look at the advertising prudacts and know more about whats the new inventions.     But in addition to the big companies and there own prudacts which its usfull.They have to work hard to let us know more about there prudacts by advertising about it on TV or at any other way where we can look after and give it a big part of attention where it needs, for me, i'd love to read or see any commercial adversting about  computers and what is the new invintions wither i need it or i dont.      in conclusion, i think we are all getting the benifit we need from those who advertise for there prudacts and also they are getting the same benifit in the way they want it .</td>\n",

       "      <td>I agree with this sentence ,because of alot of reasons                            The first thing is that advertisement helps  show the new products to peaple so they can decide to bye it or not .For example  i was searching for a new tredmil so i can exercise on it and decrease my weight ,and i saw one that it is so unexpensive and verry effective.       But when ibought it i found that it needs a lot of personal power to make it work , the thing that idid not recognize from the tv .                    In the other hand advertisement does not give the taste of different foods and meals ,and just leave it to our imagination w hich makes our mouth watering  and that is  faraway from the real thing                    Finaly it make all of our dreams is possible by finding every thing we thought about before , but this is not true becouse we dont have the money  and even  the warantee for all these things.                       In short i beleive that advertisements are a very powereful way to make people bye products and some of them reflect the real thing about the putchases.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think that  I disagree with the following statement \" In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today \"to an extent .  I would only agree to this statement under certain conditions. Cars would only decrease in twenty years if the crude oil   diminishes by that time, I think  .Not only if it diminishes but also if it was scarce or difficult to drain out due to the lack equipments to reach far or sense such small  quantity. I say that petrol is important because with it out cars  wont move . In addition to that if this occurs the petrol price might rise and only moderate to wealthy people can afford having a car with such high expenses . I would add to that that if rude oil does decrease or diminish less factories and electrical generations would stop working and by that less classical cars would be produced .   On the other hand ,I dont really think that within 20 years this is going to happen , I hope. As i see it , for the past three to four years the cars innovation and availability in markets with various shapes , modalities sizes and brands has been increasing non stop. For instance  In Jordan which is a middle east country that is considered moderate non developed countries have had a dramatic increase in cars as its sseen in traffic jams that has been increasing each year more than the other . Not to forget mentioning the Gulf region where each family member who is licensed to drive owns his own car . Cars for guys in this region is their main obsession.Oman was considered one of the quite Gulf countries that was known for it wide empty roads for the past year its been having several rush time hours from initially starting with 2 rush our times on the way to and from work . Ultimately  , I anticipate an increase in cars on roads and in each house ,20 years from now based on what I  see today. I also think that maybe by that time new cars that are not petrol fuel consumers might be invented and in efficient  use. There was car invented that works on helium gas instead of petrol and I heard that it was seen in One of the sstreet in some western country  that i cant recall it now. In case crude oil was to finish , I have hope that scientist will create alternative sources of energy such as the solar power to provide us  a normal sophisticated life life.</td>\n",

For example:if some on has gradute from collige in one subjects like medicen, this person took almost like 8 years stadied which he want to work and make the help his\\her country after finding good job.Moreover the person  when get this sutition that's clue for this person and starting his life and making the others thing like family children, and how he\\she will think about how to have up deagre or leavel to prove his\\his self.

       "      <td>How many times have you got deceived by commercials? How many times have you regreted buying things you saw on commercials because they were not as good as they seemed? I am sure that this happened to many of you.          I think that commericals always inflate what products really are. There are many products which are not good and have lots of commercials. On the other hand, there are many products that don't do much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time. So a product having many advertisements doesn't necessarily mean that the product is good.          I can speak about this out of experience. I once saw an advertisement on the television about a soultion that removes all types of stains. I was so thrilled by the advertisement that I bought one for me and one for my sister. One day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt. I proudly got the soultion and rubbed it on the stain as instructed. Shockingly, I figured out later that the more I rubbed the more the stain spread. I was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day.            In addition, a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect. I once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste gives 12-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque. As a dentist, I knew that this didn't make any sense. There is no such thing as \"12-hour protection\". It is well-known that plaque starts growing on teeth right after you brush them.        Unfortunately, false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers.  Therefore, I think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments.</td>\n",

In peculiar,when you have the children ,you have a new situation and new life.All your past became souvenirs.

You cannot possibly watch a game or show without being intrupted by two dozens of commercials. Indeed most advertisment make products seem much better than they really are. Digital imaging and color enhancments has created products that does not exist. Bussiness owners relay on the diversty of people out there, to sell their products. Moreaver they use these fancy adevertisment to trap people into their stores.Recent inovations in the world of imaging; made everything possible. Also the use of computers to enhance colors, and enhance the Image or object; made everything seem fake. For example my sister went out shopping for a dress she saw in a fancy catalog. She was stunned the real dress did not look anything like the picture in the catalog. Another example might be the nice juciy sandwiches you see in the commercials; but never get to see them in real life. Simply becasue they are the invetntion of a camera and a cameraman. Most businessmen relay on the diversty of people. You might not think that this is the product you' ve seen  the other day. Other individuals might think the opposite way. people are not the same; and they precive things diffrently.Other businessmen try to grab the attnetion of the costumers. For example; I went to change my car's tiers. One store had this big sign \"4 Tiers for $99\".

The huge companies main intresrt is to make an advertise for a certan product; also the will hier experts in markiting just to give a good looking for the product. However, these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different. I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before.First, I worked  for two years in an advertisement company bake home. It war really famous company and had a world wide name. One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company, and theay had a meeting later on. In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him, he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased. The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him \" don't be worry, this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality. After two months from advertising for this product, it reaches a really high number of selling; although it has a bad qeuality.Second, I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone. It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal. Therefore, I bought the cellphone, but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment.In conclusion, an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product. On the other hand, it could be used in a good or a bad way. However, some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool &gt;</td>\n",

Knowledge is what make a person special from others.Some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. This broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who has an experience in everything you want to learn about.Others think that being specialize in one specific subject is better than have board knowledge because it can help to be better in your subject. It allow you to be the best and the person who can depend on in that subject.I agree with people who think it is better to have broad knowledge and I prefer to have it rather than a person with a limit knowledge. For examble, when two persons go to a company and ask for a job one with a board knowledge and the other whith a limit knowledge I think they will choose the first person because he can be more helpfull.

       "      <td>Traffic is a big problem in great cities like Istanbul, Paris, New York. Because there are a lot of cars. The number of cars are increasing because of populations increasing. This couses more problems in traffic. Researchers are looking for alternative approaches to solve this problem. I think that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than tere are today.Firstly, researchers developing the trains.  Cars are more popular than trains in today. On the other hand,  cars popularity will decrease in future. Because in future there will be faster and more comfortable trains than in today. Governments will develop and build better railroads too. As a result of these popularity of trains will increase and popularity of cars will decrease.Morower, air travel will also be more popular in future. The number of air travel firms is increasing everyday. Because of the competition, the price of tickets is decreasing. So, air travel becomes more common and popular. People prefer going to far places by using airoplanes. The number of helicopters is increasing too. These are other factors that cause decrease in number of cars.Lastly, if you think that technology is developing very fast, you will think that trains and planes will be more popular and cheaper in a short time period. Twenty years is a short peariod of time for the developments of trains and planes. Consequently, cars will lose their popularity in twenty years. Because people will prefer travelling by trains and planes rather than travelling by cars. Technology developing will result with faster and more comfortable trains and planes. So, the number os cars will decrease in twenty years.</td>\n",

To come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today. At the past before the technological improvements there were lots of things which a humanbeing was not able to do alone. For example think about not having any washingmachine. When we think about the times that the female humanbeing must be doing all the houseworks. At these times families are much more crowded and as a result people have to wash much more clothes. Washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a women, all the other young people has to help their mother to have clean clothes. But now almost all of us have washingmachines in our house. When somebody in the family have dirty clothes he\\she don't have to call anybody. He\\she puts clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready.Year by year the population of the world is increasing. There not too much places to work and earn money. At the sum people prefer having small families such as parents and one child to have good life conditions according to their money. At the old times people were usually making farm work. When you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you, the more product you will have.Because of that people used to prefer having crowded families. And when a child has brothers and sisters it has to be social and help the others to have something to eat, to earn money or to have clothes to wear.Finally by the improvement of technology, life is much more easier but technology makes youngsters selfish. Young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I think that having a board knowledge of many academic subjects is not what our era necessitates. In our times, it seems to be more important, and more awaited to be a real expert on one specific subject. This thought of mine has many reasonings behind it.First of all, I don't think that a broad knowledge on many subjects could be useful, as long as with such a knowledge one cannot be really comfortable with all of those subjects, on which he claims to have a knowledge, and with knowing a little from everything, it is really easy to get confused when you study, or prepare a project. Actually, that is why teamwork is important in business life. Since a project cannot be prepared by one person, it is distributed among a group according to the specializations of members of that group. Thus specialization is favoured in industry.Secondly, I do not think that such a broad knowledge is needed in industry, though specialization in one field is necessary to have a succesful career. Since  at our level of technology everything is hidden in details, and thoughts that make differences are at minor scale, one should be able to observe the subject, and problem that he is working on with all aspects. According to my opinion, an understanding that through, and detailed is only possible with high level of specialisation. Thirdly, a broad acedemic knowledge means that person works on very many, and irrelevant topics. Yes, with such a working style you are working on a wide range of subjects, and you are continuously changing your study topic, and you know some of everything, and you seem to be successful with a lot of work fields you have, but you lack one, and a very important thing: Experience. Experince is, maybe, the most wanted speciality of a person, that is to be in high levels of his career. It had become to this that, experience is the key to a succesful business life. And i do not think that a broad academic knowledge distracts one`s focus, thus gaining experience is harder with that kind of knowledge, than the case with a specialisation field.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nowadays , companies in the growing competitive environment  have started to focus on more effective advertisement techniques. To present their products better they have begun to show a lot of aspects of their  products.While some people claim that by doing that companies are overpresenting the quality or the purpose of their products, some people think that companies try  to show product`s features as close as possible to the reality. In the improved industrial societies , i don`t think advertisements would make products seem much better that they really are for the following reasons.        First , the main purpose of the advertisement is to sell the product. However , today there is something called customer satisfaction in the corporate world. If the customer percevies the product of much better quality. Then, as he uses the product, if he can`t get the quality that he was expecting ,the first  to suffer from that would be the company. Therefore , in todays competitive corporate world, i don`t think  any company would take the risk of losing the customers. Moreover, the improved and new consumer protection laws prevent the companies from frauding the customer by penalizing those actions.According to the law, company that provides the product or service should inform the consumer fully before entering into sales contract or transaction.        To conclude,  main idea of the advertising is to make the product attractive but not  seem  better than they are. Not only the increased protection of consumers by laws , but also the increased competition among companies over the market share by raising the customer satisfaction and having loyal customers will prevent the companies to make their products look better than they really are.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Since the serial manifacturing of cars, they had become a really important part of human lives, as they decreased the time required for transportation. As people's needs for transportation will not decrease, it is really hard to say that there will be fewer cars in the near future. People use cars in their everyday lives and, for people today, it is hard to imagine any period of time without cars. There had been other forms of transportation in the past, but; none has been used as frequently as modern cars. One could claim that a newer form of transport may evolve. Some people even say that, we may be able to teleport in the near future, however; this suggestion has yet only lived in science fiction books. Therefore, in the near future, as near as twenty years, people are unlikely to see a newer form of invention that will close the era of modern cars. Cars' looks, types of fuel they use or their engine systems may change, but; after all, they will still be cars. Even if cars began not to move on four wheels, but; instead, started to fly; as we see in science fiction movies like \"Back To The Future\", they would still be called \"cars\". That is because, they will still be belonging to an individual and be used just like the way we use them today. As stated before, their way of working, that is; their engine system, ignition type, fuels etc. may change; however, they will still be \"the personal transportation device\".As a result, when we look at the 20th and the beginning of 21st century, it is almost impossible to see cars vanish from the market all of a sudden. Lots of people are happy with this as well, as long as oil prices are kept at a reasonable price. Maybe, the 22nd century will become free of cars and car addicts would surely be glad that they are not to see those times.</td>\n",

When I was child really I could agree above the statement. But now everything changed. In our time students want to learn reality.Students especially nowadays can learn a lot different subject from different sources. These sources can be internet or television. And also foreign countries television can be watched fron students and they can see different point of views. Also some countries they can learn real history of their countries and war reasons. After that at class Students can ask teacher some questions about fact. Before this was not, when teacher whatever  says students can take this idea or concept. For example before I learnt from my teacher about First World War, according to his statements;  we lost the war because our alliens lost. But now I learnt the facts from different sources especially foreign sources everything is different. All my ideas and concepts confused. Globalization started in the world. After globalization lectures , teachers or speakers any meetings or any speaking places must pay attention every sentence. Students now can questioned every word and every idea. Therefore, giving lectures all the time should developed their knowledges. Students can make for searching because of much spare time. Teachers can not much time for searching time because marriage and having children can stop them.Consequently, all the time lecturers shoul leran facts all the subjects especially about history because now every human-being can reach every knowledge or every country all over the world. They can also meet a lot different countries people and they can learn from them, from television, from internet every reality and facts. Because The world is globalizationing.</td>\n",

By tour guide you have a lot of oppurtunity to chose where you will go and where to stay and what to do. If you decided to go to some historical places to see, the tour guide would be the best guide for group. Because they know everything about that places, they know how to get there where should be seen, what is the whole story about that historical place.if you dont have a guide you should get a book about that places and start to read it.it is not exciting as the tour guide telling you about the story. they also play like in that time and imitate the people who placed in the story. people in the group think about that story and they like it more than they read a book about it.when i came to United State in my first time i joint a group with my friend.threre was a tour guide leading to the group. it was very exciting for me,because the tour guide had wear like the old people in that time and he was explaning to us what we see and what the story is. i remembered a historical place where i went in my country,there was no one to tell us about history of that places,it wasnt exciting like the one i had in the U.S. it is the best travel to lead by a tour guiede.</td>\n",

To create a differance from these people who are only working hard and wasting time by only obeying the comments of upper statues, what can you do? The thing that you can do, can be trying new things and taking risks.  First of all, trying new things shows the creavity. That means you do not only taking the information, you also analyse it and try to give a new proposal or product. It gives a different value to the job. For instance, if there are two managers that one is only trys to keep the work contunious and the other one also doing his job well but he also wants to increase next year`s bugget by changing his work princible that may be increasing the money that spent for the researchs or entering an area that has not been exist yet. Doing things that are different than what you do every day can increase your point. Secondly, in order to be creative, you should take some risks. The things that you do may cause a diseaster but they also give good results. If you do not try, you can never answer this question. Taking risks after analysing the situation do not seem horrible. At the end, more success and money can be riched. Therefore, when we compare the events, the results are like this:If you do not take any risk, you seem stationary that will be all right for someone.

       "      <td>I don`t agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do, i believe the opposite statement which expresses that older people enjoy life more than younger people do.Because i believe there are several reasons that prevent youngers to be more effective in their own lives which can be based on the fact that the young people should spend much time by studying for exams or by having stress because of the uncertainity of what they will confront in their future. Time that passes too fast,  has a strong pressure on youngers which prevents to enjoy from their lives.But when we think of a 60 year old adult who had earned enough money till that age of her life and prepared a good opportunity to be able to supply a good education to their children, has her peace and she has no more challenges with life any longer. Therefore, she has a huge time to have fun, and nothing to loose except money.Besides, because of the fact that time passes so fast, a 60 year old adult doesn`t think of anything else except having a great time till her death. As the person feels that death is sooner coming, there won`t be any other struggles or any fights with life whatever the reason is.As i give my mother as an example, she is a typical retired teacher who has enough money to live, and has no responsibility for looking after a child. For that reason she feels free to live without thinking of any doubths or fears. She is going to trips with her friends and having great time with self satisfaction. She lives her own by the power of not having huge responsibilities such as earning money or looking after a child.Consequnetly i can express that when i look forward future, i would rather to be more older just in case to be able to be more effective in life, by not just trying to do what life requires and also to do things for myself either.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last night while I was preparing for my history of economic analysis exam, I really spent a lot of time in learning ideas and concepts rather than the facts. I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are many reasons of this situation.            First of all, ideas and concepts are more important than facts in the exams. In general, the questions are about ideas and concepts. The teachers place them too much importance, they spent too much time about them in the classes and moreover they want too much knowledge from students about ideas and concepts in the exams. For example, in my exams the questions are generally related with the ideas and concepts rather than facts. Therefore, I work for the ideas and concepts much.            Another reason is that in education system in my country, it is not very necessary to know the facts . On the other hand, the education systems encourages the students to learn and understand ideas and concepts. Ideas and concepts have more pages than the facts in course textbooks and they are discussed in more detail than the concepts. Therefore, the students place a bigger importance on ideas and concepts than facts.            Understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding the facts for the students. To learn about the ideas and concepts can help students more in the exams and the education system also encourages students to learn them rather than learning the facts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for  manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads cannot change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative. A close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated.A main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated. The state decides about what can and can't be said in ads by  legislating about ads and competition. That makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits: An angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company. Since advertising companies are aware of that, they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for.Another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status doesn't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products, but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell. How many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts? The answer is none. And since most ads do not inform anyway, it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are.Perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product's quality is in most cases subjective. For instance, some people like onion soup while others hate it.  Some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it. So, one's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product. This subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive.In conclusion, the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons: State regulation, the advertisement's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I agree that most of the advertiesements are used to make products seem much netter than they really are. We can see many exaples of this phenomenon in our daily lives. Ads have been an inevitable component of the daily media, such as TVs, newspapers, radio, even along the wall of the subways we use to go work every day. the advertisments are continously trying to make us believe that some products are worth buying. By without even we got influenced by them, we by tons of equipment that we do not even need at all. A serious problem I see with the advertisements that they lack honesty most of the time. generally, those who prepare tyhe ads resort to tricks and misleading statements that show their products  better that they actually are. In the following, I will give my obsrevations on this issue. Firstly, I think that most ads try to show  a product different than what it actually is because there are many similar products of the same kind in the market. Therefore, advertisements use some lies to make their products distinguished among all its competitors. recently, I needed some cutting equipment forthe kitchen. In one of the examples, i saw a set of equipment which is told to be able decrease the time spent in the kitchen to half. The knife kit was shown to be able to form varuious structures to cut different vegetables. It was said to hae a mode for potatoe kneeling anothe mode for peeling carrots. having influenced by this, I ordered the specific set of knives. However, the result shocked me. What I bought turned out to be a simle set of knives bundled with some simpel plasic boxes. Obviously, I felt cheated.  this is an example how advertisements can be effective in showing things different than they truly are.Moreover, I think the technique of distorting the truth has become the unofficial definition of the advertisement. There are many examples to convince me to think so. Today, the advertisers use various techniques to show the products brighter than they are. They use television shows to `prove` the usefullness of the product. However, all those shows are set up previously. They consist of people just playing their roles to convince us on the merits of a product. Today, there are even some Tv channels just for this purpose. Advertising relies on exxagerating the positie sides of a product while suppressing the negative sides. An example is thebrochures of holiday resorts. Theyu always show high storey buildings with a big swimming poo in front. the scene is always bright with a smiing face in teh background. Once I have been decepted by the beauty of such a brochure to buya holiday program on seaside. however, what I ended up when I arrived the holiday resort was a disaster. thre was a pool, but it was not functioning. the picture on the brochure did not belong to the actual building. This was a very bad experince, which strenghtens my belief on the fact that advertiesements are used to make products seem much netter than they really are.As a conclusion, I agree that advertiemnts are used to sho the products better than they are. I think this is done in order to make a specific product distinguishable among other similar ones. Moreover, I believe that this approach has been the norm among the advertisers. Therefore, one should be very careful when making results based on ads. The results can be very disappointing, as it was the case for my kitchen tool or my disastrous summer holiday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Young People and CommunitiesIn our developing world many things being changed. Nowadays, young people do not spend their time for their comminications. I agree, that young people do not give enough time for the communities. I beleive that young people has some reasons for to not have enough time for communities.First of all, our world changing everday.Nowadays people need money to stay alive so it is sometimes hard to spend time to helping communities. Being a human brings more resposilities and hard work. Some young people working in part time job they do not only earn money but also they earn experience. For instance; I do not hate to spend time for my community on the contrary i love it. In fact, I am working in my business and studying in university so I do not have enough time for my community. World getting harder and harder each day to stay alive thats why young people spendign their time mostly to earn money.  Secondly, there is other reason which is effective on young people to not have time for comminity. In our world technology developes by day and day. After internet has been dicovered young people gets worse and worse cause of it pushes person to lonely life. I accept that internet makes our life easier while we loose our young generation to spend more time on internet instead of our communities.For example; I prefer to stay at home and surf on internet rather that to spend time in my community. In conclusion, I think, that young people have reasons to not spend their time in communties. I belive that young people will have more time to spend their time to helping their communities in the future.</td>\n",

It is clear that having the knowledge of so many different academical subjects is really important thing. By this way, people may gain the speciality of looking at a subject from different point of views and expressing their opinions on many different areas, however expertising on an academical subject is much more important than knowing lost of thing without being specialised on any of them.In the first place, since the people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not be an expert for any of the acadecimcal issues that they know, always there will be someone who are better than them and nobody will require their knowledge about that academical issues. In my opinion, knowledge is to be used and to make it be used, you should know it very well. It is not possible to gain benefit from that knowledge if you just have some broad knowledge about it both economically and personally such as gaining people's appreciation. In the second place, the main motivation behind learning an academical issue is improving the current level of society. If someone do not have a deep knowledge on an academical issue, he cannot put something on account about that issue and cannot be a useful for his society. It seems to me that whatever someone do, he should do the best. In this context, if someone is not very good on a subject, people will not evalute them according to the other subjects that he know, both the society and themselves will not get a much benefit of their knowledge without being specialized on it.</td>\n",

It is quite impossible for a person to ignore advertisements around for they are everywhere and that they are very impressive at pushing ideas into one's mind. How many times does it happen that you use a product and then you come to hate it every time you see it advertised. I believe it happens very often, because advertisements make products (or even services) seem much better that they really are in various ways. Either it doesn't look, taste, fell, etc. as expected, or there appears to be many unsatisfying aspects of it compared to a few innovative aspects which was advertised, or it becomes a short-term good product that had to be disposed.First of all, I believe the advertisements are made very professionally to make products look very fashionable, delicious, etc. Whether it is a new model of pair of jeans you see the gorgeus model wearing in the magazine or a burger someone eats so invitingly on TV... It is always the case that the jeans don't fit you when you try them on, or the burger is in pieces and has a strange unidentifiable sauce when you buy.Sometimes it is not a problem of looks that matters, problem becomes what is inside. A brand new technology gagdet you replaced your old one with - which we all happen to do often in this world of consumption - makes you miss that old technology. Apart from the new useful aspect that was was advertised, you struggle to make use of the product because you are always busy complaining and pointing out to people around you they never say everything in advertisements.The last case I always come accross is - although rare, at least as annoying as others - that the obtained product satisfies the owner in every way the advertisement said it would. Neverthless, nobody's allowed to live happily ever after. The product is broken and it cannot be repaired or replaced. These are just a few examples of what I</td>\n",

I agree with the fact that there are more people working hard for their communities than who do not care for them. Firstly, people who have the right moral attitudes and behaviours should be aware of the envoirment they live in. And they should always try to develop it for the better. I assume that our world have enough conscious people to do so. Therefore people may be able to leave a liveable world to their children and the others who come after them. However, they might be very busy with their careers and their lives, improving our envoirment and developing it must include one of their goals. Having a good life should not be the only thing they care for or rely on. Likewise they won't have better enough lives in an uncared community. They can't live without caring for one another. There are people that suffer from hungar and the wars that damage their homes. I see on tv that a great number of people are working to make the conditions better. They try to find them places to live, adopt the children who have anybody left and fund for their loss. Even for the people who do not take action at all, there are campaigns avaible everywhere. It is the easiest way for them who do not stand up from their chairs they sit and at the same time they would still be helpful.To sum up, if people consider the fact that this world is not only ourselves but everyone's who lives in it, they will probably be more helpful for their community and try to change it for the better.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nowadays cars are the most common transportaion vechiles for human race. The reasons for this fact are firstly cars are individualstic so you can use whenever you want. Secondly it can be faster than public transportation. Finally and absolutely cars are much more comfortable than any other vechiles.But what are going to happen to cars in future? I think in future the cars will be use less often than today. There are too many reasons for this opinion. For example in my country the number of cars are increasing but the roads can't be enough for this much cars and the drivers are exhausted about traffic jam so they start to think about getting rid of their cars and using public transport. Furthermore I think the biggest problem is gasoline prizes. They are getting higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy any. These are the socio-economic disadvantages of using cars.Also there are different possibilities to make cars less important and less usable. Technology is growing so fast and scientsit can make faster trains, faster planes and the stations and airports are becoming more comfortable places and the tickets for more comfortable transportation aren't as high as they were before. By this way using plane isn't a luxury anymore. Furthemore technology might make a flying cars like in science-fiction movies. i think this isn't a waiting for too much because 40 years ago automatically openning doors were utopia in books or movies but they are real and common now. So maybe someday we will travel by flying on ourselves not in planes.In conclusion by the developing of technology and the socio-economis difficulties of having cars makes us to find alternative ways to transport. Even now cars are very popular that doesn't mean that it will go on like that. New discoveries will make cars unpopular but this will take long time.</td>\n",

Implying that young people, out of lack of experience, make a lot of mistakes and people old enough to become experienced do not have the time to use their experience fully, one has to conclude that the old people have no choice but to enjoy life more than the young ones. Young people have fun, live adventures, keep falling in and out of love, yes: all of this is true. Yet do they really know what they're doing? Are they even aware of how they're wasting the precious time they have? No. Only after they reach a certain age can they appreciate the value of experiences. Only after losing the opportunity of living the life they really want to live can they understand how valuable their past memories are and value the little time they have left to complete their unfinished businesses before they die. Do not mistake me, I am not at all implying that the elder have the energy to get up and go out and have fun in the exact  same way a young person can. I'm simply saying that whatever they do, even if it is the simplest thing to do like feeling the wind on one's skin or eating a homemade meal cooked by their wives, they do it with utmost intensity. After all, it's not the quantity that counts, but the quality.    One more reason I believe the older people enjoy life more than young people is because the young people, no matter how successful they have been that far, still have a life ahead of them, full of worries: Are they going to be successful? Are they going to be able to properly support a family? Older people, having lived through these worries, are past this episode of tension and are relieved. If they have grandchildren, for instance, they know that it is their biggest accomplishment. If they do not have grandchildren, on the other hand, they are aware that worrying will be useless for there's the chance has passed them. So all they have to worry about is enjoying the rest of what's left of their lives.  Examples and situations may vary with personalities and periods. Yet one thing stays the same, the fact that even though young people believe that they're enjoying life more than older people, it is the exact opposite. Therefore even though as a twenty one year old person myself, I tend to wish that I am enjoying life better than my seventy year old grandparents, their quality of enjoyment is much better than mine.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Being young or being older influence the decisions, personal characters and the way of life, as well. By statement the way of life, I refer not only type of living but also the enjoment of that life. Do young people enjoy life more than the elderly? I agree with that statement, because youngsters are more enegetic, not stessful about the future, and not reluctand to experince new things. On the other hand, due their valuable experinces, senior citizens could have chance to enjoy more than youth.Firstly, the younger people, due to very biological and hormonal feature of their bodies, are very enegetic, which could not be compared to energy of older people. Being energetic gives youngsters a chance to do too many things within very short periods of time. On the other hand, elderly even there are too many energetic old people, cannot due the same amount of things within the same period and also within the same quality.Secondly, young people do not worry to much about their prospective futures. Of course, they have some kind of concerns about their careers and study but it is better to think about the end of the life like somehow elderly do. It is more probable to the elderly to feel deppressive due to feeling old. Finally, younger people do not have any oppositions against living and experiencing new things, such as new tastes, new adventures and even new friends. In contrast, senior citizens generally prefer to live in peace rather than in adventures. They have more concerns to continiue the stablity of their lives, which makes them somehow conservative, as well.In addition, we should not forget that due to their valuable expereinces, elderly in some cases can enjoy the life more. For instance, their experinces allow them to know what to do in which time.I hold the view that younger people enjoy life better and more than elderly.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I agree with the only first part of the statement which says that \"Successful people try new things and take risks\"  because this is the precondition for achievement in both business and personal life. However, I disagree with the rest  of the statement which emphasizes that the successful people do not simply do what they already know how to do well. In my opinion, these people can become successful by the help of the things that are already familiar with them. Now I would like to mention the basic ideas behind my contention. First of all, trying new things and taking risks require a high level of self confidence and this is one of the most significant characteristics that many successful people possess. Self-confidence enables them to apply new methods or take new decisions in their both professional and business lives. Moreover, being open to new developments or ideas widens the people's perceptions regarding the issues or concepts and so this brings the success. Furthermore,to take risks may at the same time lead to increase in chance for invention. In other words, it can be accepted as a way to be an inventor of something. On the other hand, all of these can not be possible without using the old knowledge. That is to say, a person can be more self-confident if he or she really trusts his or her own knowledge, experience and ability which had gained before. Most of the time, by relying on their already acquired skills, they are able to become successful. In addition to this, the experience gathered from previous tasks provides remarkable clues about the nature of the risks. By already predicting the results of the risks, many successful peopl decide to take a certain risk. In other words, while they take the risks and try new things, they also guarantee themselves. This generally becomes apparent in the case of the businessmen working for many years and knowing the inside of the business issues.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There have always been arguments or complains about the behaviours of young generations among the older generations, It is an historical attitude of human in all periods of time. So the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities looks like a cliche and I do not agree with it. There are some reasons for my argument.First, the statement seems to me like a cliche because when my mother is making such kind of complains, she says that her mother was also making similar complains to her. Furthermore I have read an article about this topic and it is stated that in the writings of ancient civilizations there were complains about younger generations. What i mean that, the reason of such statement is the fight between generations.Second, we have to look at what does it mean helping community? I thing it depends on the time. For example, in the time of Second World War, working in a hospital as a volunteer meant helping community. From another perspective, children of a farmer can help their father in field so they may at the same time be helpful for the comunity. However, for the time being, young people are able to contribute their society throug sitting before the computer for hours. The activity has change by the time by it has always been the young generations who come up with the new ideas that lead to developments.as a result, we are live in a global world the most important aspect of which is information revolution. Quality of work in many areas depends on brain force not on the muscle force. People can work in their home with their personal computer and achieve much more things then before in a short time. By the same token, young people are also follow these developments. They learn many realities of the world and develop ideas for their solution by searcing in Internet in a very short time. It is not necessary any more to participate some kind of socially responsible clups, be aware of realities of world and develop an attitude. There is short ways of doing everything including helping society.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The humankind always should invent and use new products to be the modern person therefore using new products is an impotant aspect in humankind's life because it could harm the humankind.I personally don't agree with idea of making the product advertisements much better than they really are.These are my following reasons.First of all,The humankind always need to intelligent in different situations but not selling the bad product with a very nice advertisement to sell more than they plan to.All the people would like the product advertisements which are most of lie.For example,I have listened and watched to an advertisement of a new toothpaste that showing the new product as a very efficient thing for your mouth health.But when I had listened to the radio I have figured out that the new product is a just typical toothpaste that don't have any additional ingredients rather than the regular toothpastes.In my opinion Humankind should do more important things that could develop our generation rather than selling typical products with good advertisements.In addition to this,The humankind should'nt believe to the advertisements that are not lying on proofs,For example,A person wants to buy a shampoo that he has got used to but he sees a new product that is the half price of the shampoo he got used to,Wouldn't he just try out once because of the price no matter his or her budget is.In my opinion we all do try it once before we buy the product wer used to buy.This is a very efficient point that a lot of people have been missing or ignoring.Not only the money but also the power of it could do whatever the product owners do.For example,Have you ever seen an expensive new product in markets.The new products are always the products which are cheaper than a dozen.The last but at least is that the most important thing we should not ignore is education level of the people because of believing the new product's advertisements.It has been always a stereotype that the cheap new products have no difference with regular products.In my opinion if the humankind needs and wants to reach higher,they should educate the people rather than telling them lies about unnecessary product advertisements.Not only this generation or the next but also a lot of generation is going to live in this world.That's why we should start to change our attitudes to reach higher.I'm not telling that people should not do things such as these advertisements,They should do with in a circle of limits.All in all as I said before,Humankind have more important things than making advertisements for  new products to make them better than they really are with advertisements which could be the most efficient aspect to catch people's eye on.The long and short of it is that the humankind should be interested in more important things rather than advertisements.</td>\n",

       "1      Nowadays, knowledge has changed, methods of approach are different, concepts has become more difficut to master, students have different abilities, there are students with limited abilites and stretched to students with overwhelming abilities, this does not put an end to learning experience, as there is a question that is floating  in our minds and leads a person to a deeper thinking and makes him put his knowlege behind him. Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ?To begin with, I surley accomodate this, and it is more influencial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts, for example: what would it be better if a student knows that the sea is deep, or learns why its deep, that will give student a deeper, wider, and a variety of ways to think, students will be more efficient in their life,thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future, and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way.In the past, people had limited recources, no computers, no television, and it would be good if they had books with a quite limited explanation, so our past ansistors depended on their logic, religon, and the scenario that they pass through everyday to learn facts, which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays, inventions and innovations passed through, so what is left?Its more important to understand ideas and concepts, as I have mentioned that all facts have been produced, so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in ideas and concepts and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day, because one day he will be tested with the facts in front of him. Example: in a math exam a student gets all rules that he might need to solve the qustion, but what he needs is the concept of how to solve the question.It is not a mirracle for a student to pass his study life with flying coulors, every person owns his own mind, but the secret of each is where when and how to use it. which will result him in his/her desired outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2      When success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success. When defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal. To simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself.To find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs. For one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings. This gives him the offset of a \"jack of all trades\". He chooses to experiance all but master nothing. And as such he also finds adversity in the decisions he chose to define himself as. One would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona, but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle.Accordingly so, others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull. It is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful. Knowing ones faults and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life. But might also negatively affect a persons weaknesses when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about.In conclusion, any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one. It is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is. Knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman. It is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals. Therefore it is goals which define success, and it is only obtaining those goals that should consequently matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3      Knowing everything is what makes people intellectually perfect! Every human being looks forward to this. But the fact that know body ever fully got to that point, can bring doubts on the possibility of this issue. For some people knowing everything is what they live for. For others limitation to one academic subject is preferable.On one hand, some people, might get stubborn, and look forword to pass their life trying to answer their never ending questions.They get to a certain point, where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know, because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything. Consequently, they will continue their never ending researches, and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection.On the other hand, other people, find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely. Rather, then wasting time trying to learn about many academics, they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely. This part of the population, will be able to invest its life to its full, because they will not have to live anxiety, they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life. They will, furthermore by having this sense of proudness, be more confident in themselves then a person that works extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he/ she has accomplished.In conclusion, knowing everything, can not be reachable, at least not for the moment. Life is too short we better live it to its full, and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memories to remember in the futur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4      understanding the ideas and concepts is important in any learning process,but if the students ignore or were not able to learn and focus on the facts, that will be reflected on them in understanding the whole topic or subject.from my point of view, i think that studying and focusing on facts is not less important than studying and learning concepts and ideas and this is because of many reasons, First is the need for the implementation of ideas and concepts, so when we take the nujrsing students as an example, nursing students read the concepts of some medical terminology throughout the course of their major but if these students do not implement what they read, this will be reflected negatively on them after they graduate and start their careers, Second is the need to observe the applications of these concepts and ideas, and for this point i will mention the medical surgical students as an example, when the students only study and read the concepts of suturing and wound dressing and only look at pictures in the books, they will never be able to practice these concepts, another reason that indicates that the facts are important, the pyramids in egypt, many of the students in the school of engineering learn about the concepts of archticture used to build the pyramids and as these concepts confiscated the most of us it will be more confiscating to some of these students as will, except if they watch the illustration video for the structure and archticture of the pyramids, and the fact of building these pyramids in the inside and the outside will be more clear to them.as a conclusion, learning of ideas and concepts will be confusing for any student in any major or feild of study and will not be convincing enough, so the level of satisfaction for that student will be lower except if that student was exposed to the facts of the topic he is learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "5      the bwst way to travel is in a group led by atour guide. I agree with that for many resonse. if there is a tour guide the group will be on control, there will not be any fight about the rode, and he will be the best known of the way.     first, if there is a tour gide the group will be on control. He will control the stops by diside how much stops should they have and how long , and where should they stops.     second, there will not be any fight during the tripe. they not have any space for each one to give his opinion about the way and which one is right and which one is wrong.     third and the last, if they have a tour guide he must be the best known about the way. He must be know which way they have to go. he must know which way is right and which way is wrong. He have to realize which road is dangures and which way is not.

       "6      Young people nowadays don't care much about helping their communities,because the don't have the idea that is ,it is imprortant to partcipate in the commuinity social serveses.This idea caused by many factors including parentes,media,socity ,friends and thier priorities.Parents often now engourage their kids to consetrate on their studying which is important of course  but they have also rememper not forgot helping the community.young people watch media intensivly but unfortunatly media doesn't support this case that much ,media channels prefer to show things that attract people like big news,celebrties life and movies .The socity has an infleuance on the young people but not that much  infleuance ,the families who that make the socite tend to be not as close as in the past ,they care about themselves and they do not worry about taking care of somebody else .Freinds are a greate factor among each other they talk to each others ,and exchange ideas,but thier priorities have changed now ,they are concern about parties ,girls,movies,cars and wasting time without much benefit.So if we provide these factors to engourage young people to participate in the commuinty serveses, and have media make shows about the greatness and the benefits of the social work.The mentalety of young people will change after providing these factors,they will tend to help their communities and be an effective individuals among others and spread take this thought to the next generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "7      Travling costs a lot of money. Have you ever thought about how much do you spend when you travle? A lot of people love travling but they do not want to spend a lot of money on travling. When people travled to a different place about which they do not have any information, they would get lost while they were looking for the places they wanted to visit. Therefore, having a tour guide with you in your travling can take to beautiful places in short time. There fore I agree on that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because by that, the tour guide entertained you and save your times which are the most important things during your travling. The first benefit of have a tour guide is that he entertains you. the tour guide have a big knowlagde about the place where he tours you. For example, supose you do not know about the good places in Califronia and you went to it. If you did not have a tour guide, you would not good any places except the ones that near by your hotel. In addition, if asked people about the good places, they would not tell you because they might not remeber them. However the tour guide job is to know the good places that will make the tourists entertained. Finally, the tour guide would try his hardest to entertained you, so that you might like him and tell othe pople about him. The second point is theat the tour guide would save a lot of your time. For exmample, one of my friend went to Riyadh, which is the capitel city of Soudi Arabia, with out a tour guide. He thought that since he lives in a country that is near by Saudi Arabia, he should know where to go in Riyadh. On the contrary, hey got lost in it and waste a lot of time looking for the good places and hotels to stay in. His plan eas to spend one week in Riyadh but he spent tow weeks. When I asked him about his trip, he said that he should have rented a tour guide. Eventhough, he went with a group who also have good information about Riyadh, the got lost. Opponents of having a tour guide in a group maintain that it cost money having a tour guide. However, having a tour guide would cost less on what you would spen on transportation by getting lost. In conclusion, you would save time and be entertaind if you have a tour fuide in a travle with a group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8      In my point of view i agree that people should have the risk in trying new things instead to doing things in life that he/she is used to doing.If people dont try doing things that they are not used to do they will never learn in life. Life changes life will never stay the same so you have to go out and see what is going on around the world, dont be shy to ask people things that you dont know other wise you will never learn, never feel imbarased to ask becasue people also did not have a clue what they are doing before asking and looking up in book, internet or magazines. If there is things in life that you dont know and you have asked several people about it and they still not know never give up about it, act ast it was a challange to you, if you don't fight and work hard and ask people any time you go and look up something else and you can't find it beleive me that you will never find out anything in your life. Life is tuff but you have to be tuffer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "9      The foremost business philosopher in America Jim Rohn said, \"To survive in the twentieth century you have to know more than one skill.\" Today, life is changing at a very high pace and more than ever before.  The computer age which revolutianized every possible aspect in the world has gotten us to what we call the age of knowledge where to specialize in one specific subject is not enough in order to fulfill one's self.  Therefore it is better and imperative that one gets specialized in more than one domain for economic reasons and personal reasons.Everyone wants to lead comfortable lives and have a safe future.  Most of us want to be rich.  To do so, nobody is going to be specialized in only one field because now, and more than ever, all fields are related to another.  For instance, let's take real estate.  An investor who wants to invest in real estate has to have an education in business, law, finance, banking, and even construction.  If this investor is only familiar in business, how can he know about taxation policies, or about which kind of construction material to choose from?  Therefore, a knowledge in more than one subject can prove a valuable asset when it comes to increasing wealth.To seek knowledge is everyone's personal ambition.  The process is tough and lifelong.  It requires a thirst for learning and a hunger to seek the many truths which our world stores.  To have knowledge in a lot of subjects is a virtue in society.  It gives reputation and instant recognition.  Take a company that wants to hire a new employee and  that has the possibility of choosing two candidates:  a person having a business degree who has worked only in one kind of firm all his life, and another holding the same degree who has worked in many differenet trends of business.  The company should choose the latter since he's been exposed to the world more than the other candidate.  Also, having an idea of a lot of subjects can be self satisfying since no one can laugh at the person or try to trick him.  The world is filled with cons and crook men.  If you're limited to only one type of education, the chances of you being cheated are very high.  Therefore having a broad knowledge in many domains can be rewarding on a personal basis.To sum up, being involved in more than one subject is much better than being only involved in one for many reasons  such as economic reasons and personal reasons.  Today the world obliges us to invest our time in education since it will affect our living conditions.  Being more knowledgeable is also rewarding in that it gives a good image and reputation and can serve as a defence against cheating.  And the most important thing is to keep learning, keep living, loving, and leaving a legacy for others to follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "11     I agree with the statement that says, most advertisements make products seemmuch better than they really are. For several reasons this statement is true. For example, advertisements show only the good part of a product, and their only concern is to sell the product to the consumer no matter what suits him.Advertisements only show how the product is great and wounderfull, and they even show it in a way that makes it look different. Let us take a children's gum or a lolypop for instance, in advertisments you can see two or more children grabing one of those sweets, and when they try it, their appearance and the whole world changes around them and all of it becomes like a sweet dream. Now , what kind of messege would an advertisement give to a child?  The answer is clear when you just take a look at a child in sweets section in any super market. Those children who will try the dreamy product will feel that they wear tricked, simply because they will remain in their same spot with a normal taest.Advetisements do care only about gitting bought regardless of wheather they suits the buyer or not. Let us take clothes for instance, in advertisements you can see people from different ages wearing tha same styile and the same colors and the same fit. Now, what would such an advertiement make people think is alright? The answer is also clear from what you can see in the streets of poeple wearing things that are not appropriate for thier ages.In conclusion, I agree that most advertismen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "12     The issue of whether we should travel in a group or alone has been widly debated spcially after the events that  happened around the world. Some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Other people like to travel alone and without a tour gide. Both approaches have advantages and disadvatages. Although, tour guide gives more and easy information about the places, socities, people, and the history of the country that we visite, I would rather traviling alone and without tour guide.Some people may argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It is more easy to descover ; so this argument goes, the places and avoide any trubles. However, traveling is an enjoment that icloudes discovering new things and knowing different people and get in touch with different culturals. Therefore, if I travel in a group led by a tour guide, I will be controlled by the guide's directions and I wolud not be able to act and get in touch with others by my own way.Moreover, travel alone or with a good friend not with a group that I do not know provides me with a uniqe experience. For example, three years ago I traveled to the United Arab Emirates with my best friend, Jack,  . Eventhough non of us use to live or being there before, we had a very good time and experience. We rent a care from Abu Dhabi, the capital city, and we almost went every where in the country just by using the mabs and asking people in streets.In conclussion, I believe that traveling alone and without been attached to any group  gives  the most wonderful experience in the life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "13     King Faisal once said\" working for your country is the best way to show your belonging and caring for it\" when king Faisal became the king of Saudi Arabia he's first deed was to give people the cahnace to participate and do thier best in working to devolpe the Kimgdom of Saudi Arabia. I don't think it will be fair if we said that young people don't give enough time to helping thier communities, because if this was true there won't be amy people who will do anything to get a good aducation and defending the Kingdom.      Getting a good education is one of the reasons that will suport my point. In order to get a high level of aducation you really must work hard  which will take alot of effort and time. By mantaning a college degree the person will be able to work and make himself useful, for example my cousin is an engineer in a good company and he's making alot of money for the company, once he got a rewarde from prince Nasser for an excellent project he had acomlished.          Also we can charity as away to spend our time helping the communtie. nowdays all muslims from oll of the world  are fasting the Holy month of Ramadan. During this month alot of young people and children are encourged to spend their time doing somethings good for the comunity, Princes Joharah opened an aducational center for orphens and had invited every one. I visted this center and i have been teaching children how to read and write Arabic for the past three days. It took four hours a day but it is reallu a great experince              I think now it's abvoiusally clear why i think young people do spend alot of time helping their communtiy. However there will be alot of things that might keep us busy but we always should remind ourselves to our duties to the communitie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "14     I agree with the statement that says\" In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today\"   I think that the statemnt is right because of many reasons, one of this reasons is the technology in our life this days, if we talk about the present time we will see that the cars are essenial in our life, before a very long time, cars was not necessary for transportation they can use trains or bicycle and mostly they used to walk , and in near past, everyone used to have one car, a whole family consist of large number of  brothers and sisters, sons and daugther used to have just one car , but in these days every person could have two or more cars, in this we see how technology became a part of our live.   In future i think  there wont be cars at all or at least not in this huge amount that we have it in this days, i think that the scentists will discover other ways for transportation, they would change the car using petroul by other with different shape using light or using other thing, or even future people could have a bag in their back, and whenever they want to go to some where they just press a little button and they fly  or even wearing a shoes which makes you to jump a large distance or thousand of ideas that will make us not  using the cars and the trains , which makes our atmosphere clearer and better way to live.  Alhough i think that this step will happen in future, but i dont think it will happen in near future, because this kind of step needs a plan with the risks that could be taken in such cases, with opprotunity for everyone to have this venture,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "15     Ever since I have been introduced to the learning system in our country, I have been always faced with two approaches while learning: The American approach versus the French approach to deliver knowledge. Whereas the French system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic, the American way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic. But the question is: Which one is the best? Here lies the \"chicken first or egg first problem\".Some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject. This way, the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it.As an example, if I want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on, I would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it.While this approach is followed by many, others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts. In other words, by being exposed to facts, students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated, leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient. In other words, if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above, instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on, the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject, thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea.I emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts.I can still remember the effect's power that a fact will leave on students, at least on me when I was back at the university. I was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "16     Advertising is growing more and more everyday. I agree with the point that says advirtising is showing us that the commercial product is really needed while its not. like a commecial that we dont have to use it in your life at all couse for me, i dont have to use it.      like someone telling you that my 15 years old doughter wants to buy any product that she see in the TV to show her to her friends at school or becouse its just in the TV. And also for no reason to use it while she dont need it, she just want to buy it.      Also i agree that we sometimes need to see, read and watch about that commecial prudacts to know about things which its useful for our life while we dont know about it at all or we just dont know what is the prudact is needed for. Although they are playing with our minds by using a fake results they got or when the dont show us the bad effects of the prudact the are advertising about.      Additionally, commercial advsrtising is taking a big part of our life becouse its around us wherever we go, like in the streets while we are driving our cars, the resturants, and any place where its making an attention.       I also beleive that its also effecting our daily life becouse i could buy an advertising news paper just to look at the advertising prudacts and know more about whats the new inventions.     But in addition to the big companies and there own prudacts which its usfull.They have to work hard to let us know more about there prudacts by advertising about it on TV or at any other way where we can look after and give it a big part of attention where it needs, for me, i'd love to read or see any commercial adversting about  computers and what is the new invintions wither i need it or i dont.      in conclusion, i think we are all getting the benifit we need from those who advertise for there prudacts and also they are getting the same benifit in the way they want it .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "17     I agree with this sentence ,because of alot of reasons                            The first thing is that advertisement helps  show the new products to peaple so they can decide to bye it or not .For example  i was searching for a new tredmil so i can exercise on it and decrease my weight ,and i saw one that it is so unexpensive and verry effective.       But when ibought it i found that it needs a lot of personal power to make it work , the thing that idid not recognize from the tv .                    In the other hand advertisement does not give the taste of different foods and meals ,and just leave it to our imagination w hich makes our mouth watering  and that is  faraway from the real thing                    Finaly it make all of our dreams is possible by finding every thing we thought about before , but this is not true becouse we dont have the money  and even  the warantee for all these things.                       In short i beleive that advertisements are a very powereful way to make people bye products and some of them reflect the real thing about the putchases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "19     I think that  I disagree with the following statement \" In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today \"to an extent .  I would only agree to this statement under certain conditions. Cars would only decrease in twenty years if the crude oil   diminishes by that time, I think  .Not only if it diminishes but also if it was scarce or difficult to drain out due to the lack equipments to reach far or sense such small  quantity. I say that petrol is important because with it out cars  wont move . In addition to that if this occurs the petrol price might rise and only moderate to wealthy people can afford having a car with such high expenses . I would add to that that if rude oil does decrease or diminish less factories and electrical generations would stop working and by that less classical cars would be produced .   On the other hand ,I dont really think that within 20 years this is going to happen , I hope. As i see it , for the past three to four years the cars innovation and availability in markets with various shapes , modalities sizes and brands has been increasing non stop. For instance  In Jordan which is a middle east country that is considered moderate non developed countries have had a dramatic increase in cars as its sseen in traffic jams that has been increasing each year more than the other . Not to forget mentioning the Gulf region where each family member who is licensed to drive owns his own car . Cars for guys in this region is their main obsession.Oman was considered one of the quite Gulf countries that was known for it wide empty roads for the past year its been having several rush time hours from initially starting with 2 rush our times on the way to and from work . Ultimately  , I anticipate an increase in cars on roads and in each house ,20 years from now based on what I  see today. I also think that maybe by that time new cars that are not petrol fuel consumers might be invented and in efficient  use. There was car invented that works on helium gas instead of petrol and I heard that it was seen in One of the sstreet in some western country  that i cant recall it now. In case crude oil was to finish , I have hope that scientist will create alternative sources of energy such as the solar power to provide us  a normal sophisticated life life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "20     I disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is confusing and wasting time.When you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you won't be able to focus on specific subject. So, you probaply won't be able to determine which subject you should choose.In addition to that, you will be wasting your time to know about diffrent subjects you batter save this time for your subject that you like for example, If I am interested in art I should look for subjects that are related to art. that will make me more interested in art and also having more knowledge about art. However, If I am interested in many subjects I will spend alot of time to know about many subjects that I amn't really interested in.In short, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is confusing and wasting time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "21     Yes i agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people. Because the young people they have more energy to play, to do many things, to live their life not like the older people. They already enjoyed there life when they were young.

       "22     First of all knowledge is very imprtant to every body adults or even children, so we should know about genaral things in our life, but my answer if i do i agree or not, i disagree.when you ask me why i choised this one, i will tell you that it's true to know as much as you can and take knowledge but when you take just one thing and fouces on it bileve me yoy will do good work.So taken one thing and fouces on it will make you not like every body you will be jenouse becouse you will appear your self and will shine. For example:if some on has gradute from collige in one subjects like medicen, this person took almost like 8 years stadied which he want to work and make the help his\\her country after finding good job.Moreover the person  when get this sutition that's clue for this person and starting his life and making the others thing like family children, and how he\\she will think about how to have up deagre or leavel to prove his\\his self. Espeacilly in this time knowlege its very iportant things in our life as i said. Finally this was my opinoion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "23     How many times have you got deceived by commercials? How many times have you regreted buying things you saw on commercials because they were not as good as they seemed? I am sure that this happened to many of you.          I think that commericals always inflate what products really are. There are many products which are not good and have lots of commercials. On the other hand, there are many products that don't do much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time. So a product having many advertisements doesn't necessarily mean that the product is good.          I can speak about this out of experience. I once saw an advertisement on the television about a soultion that removes all types of stains. I was so thrilled by the advertisement that I bought one for me and one for my sister. One day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt. I proudly got the soultion and rubbed it on the stain as instructed. Shockingly, I figured out later that the more I rubbed the more the stain spread. I was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day.            In addition, a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect. I once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste gives 12-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque. As a dentist, I knew that this didn't make any sense. There is no such thing as \"12-hour protection\". It is well-known that plaque starts growing on teeth right after you brush them.        Unfortunately, false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers.  Therefore, I think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "24     I agree in this following statement.  In twenty yeas no body knows what will happen to us.  Maybe there will not be any cars or may be there will be more cas than we have right now in our time.  There are many stuff in the world that has not been discovered yet.  And no body nows about them.  In my point of view there will be many discoverings will happen that maybe more than the three fourths of the worls won't believe that this is discovered.  i would like to be there in that time and also whants to do stuff that i never dreamed of doing with these new discovered stuff.  I suppose that instead of cars, in twenty years there will be cars that could fly.  If that happens i would like to live and see that before i die and also like to try it also.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "25     If you were successful in doing some thing I daut that you want to do a nother thing to be successful. The people who are called successful are roten people they falo a sertin way and don't do new things , they don't think a lot about difrint ways they just focice on perfecting the things they do there way and if they were tring new things they won't be successful.If you knew a successful percon you'd find that he is don'ing every thing he writs for him self you dont see him doing new things or trying new ways in sted he'l stic on his own way to be succesful.Successful people don't try to do some thing difrent because they are afred and taryfid that thy wont be successful and there is nothig wrong with that but still they don't do som thing new they just stic with wat they have in sted.If successful people try to do some thing new they wont be successful any more because any person who trys a new thing he will face falier and this is natril but they face falier they won't be successful any more. Looke at all the sintest they are not succesful but they tryed new ways of doing things and befor they reash this gaget or thewory they will face hill and a lot of falier looke at menkil the famost sintes of genatics he was not succesful with his life and died not being succesful and his thyory hadin't deing nwen untel he died so if sucessful people do wat the sintest are doing I dawt that they will be successful.If you want to be successful you should stik to a sckgwel , try to be the best in a spesfic way and don't try new things unlees they are nwone because if you try new things you will end up not being successful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "26     I agree the idea about young people enjoy life mor than older people do.                                                                                                                There are several reason why i think that.                                                 The first reaonson , the young people are not the responsability than older people.May be older people have children.All the people know that there is not easy to educate children.All the time he try to give a very good condition for life.                                                                          The second reason,the young ,her aims is to go to th the club,cinema with her girls friend etc... and to get much experiences,so its very exited but the older people have passed this feeling.                                                                                                           The thrrt reason,i think the most important moment fot the older people,  when they were young.Because when you grow up,the difficulty of life incrase and also the responsability increase.                  In peculiar,when you have the children ,you have a new situation and new life.All your past became souvenirs.                                            I brief,of carse the young people enjoy life more than older people do because it is logicaly and i gave these reasons why i thinks that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "27     Lately a sharp increase in adverisment was sensed in every  part of the US. The Majority of advertisment are seen while watching televsion. You cannot possibly watch a game or show without being intrupted by two dozens of commercials. Indeed most advertisment make products seem much better than they really are. Digital imaging and color enhancments has created products that does not exist. Bussiness owners relay on the diversty of people out there, to sell their products. Moreaver they use these fancy adevertisment to trap people into their stores.Recent inovations in the world of imaging; made everything possible. Also the use of computers to enhance colors, and enhance the Image or object; made everything seem fake. For example my sister went out shopping for a dress she saw in a fancy catalog. She was stunned the real dress did not look anything like the picture in the catalog. Another example might be the nice juciy sandwiches you see in the commercials; but never get to see them in real life. Simply becasue they are the invetntion of a camera and a cameraman. Most businessmen relay on the diversty of people. You might not think that this is the product you' ve seen  the other day. Other individuals might think the opposite way. people are not the same; and they precive things diffrently.Other businessmen try to grab the attnetion of the costumers. For example; I went to change my car's tiers. One store had this big sign \"4 Tiers for $99\". Imediatly I step in; however the associate informed me that this offer is not for the size I am looking for. A freind later told me that he used  four diffrent cars, and he could not get the offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "28     Nowadays peolpe are using advertisments in many and different ways. The huge companies main intresrt is to make an advertise for a certan product; also the will hier experts in markiting just to give a good looking for the product. However, these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different. I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before.First, I worked  for two years in an advertisement company bake home. It war really famous company and had a world wide name. One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company, and theay had a meeting later on. In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him, he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased. The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him \" don't be worry, this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality. After two months from advertising for this product, it reaches a really high number of selling; although it has a bad qeuality.Second, I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone. It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal. Therefore, I bought the cellphone, but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment.In conclusion, an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product. On the other hand, it could be used in a good or a bad way. However, some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "29     Knowledge is the base of what we have. It is the thing that remain with us all over the years. Knowledge is what make a person special from others.Some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. This broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who has an experience in everything you want to learn about.Others think that being specialize in one specific subject is better than have board knowledge because it can help to be better in your subject. It allow you to be the best and the person who can depend on in that subject.I agree with people who think it is better to have broad knowledge and I prefer to have it rather than a person with a limit knowledge. For examble, when two persons go to a company and ask for a job one with a board knowledge and the other whith a limit knowledge I think they will choose the first person because he can be more helpfull. I am a person who believe in benig special in all the subject you love so I will agree with the first arguement for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "10970  Traffic is a big problem in great cities like Istanbul, Paris, New York. Because there are a lot of cars. The number of cars are increasing because of populations increasing. This couses more problems in traffic. Researchers are looking for alternative approaches to solve this problem. I think that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than tere are today.Firstly, researchers developing the trains.  Cars are more popular than trains in today. On the other hand,  cars popularity will decrease in future. Because in future there will be faster and more comfortable trains than in today. Governments will develop and build better railroads too. As a result of these popularity of trains will increase and popularity of cars will decrease.Morower, air travel will also be more popular in future. The number of air travel firms is increasing everyday. Because of the competition, the price of tickets is decreasing. So, air travel becomes more common and popular. People prefer going to far places by using airoplanes. The number of helicopters is increasing too. These are other factors that cause decrease in number of cars.Lastly, if you think that technology is developing very fast, you will think that trains and planes will be more popular and cheaper in a short time period. Twenty years is a short peariod of time for the developments of trains and planes. Consequently, cars will lose their popularity in twenty years. Because people will prefer travelling by trains and planes rather than travelling by cars. Technology developing will result with faster and more comfortable trains and planes. So, the number os cars will decrease in twenty years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "10971  I twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . i do not agree this statement because this time interval not long interval , however, when we compare the human life this interval seems long , but for  technologic life it is not a long term. we always use the car to go one place to another , and we use the road and fuel too,and lots of thing . these things related for the economy, in other hand cars and other thing which use with cars is a big trade in recently. Money is always important for human brains . They can destroy everything for money , actually lots of poems said that human body could do everything for love ,when we think about this. humans` love is money .you think that  This is not related our statement , but you are wrong , because humans love money and we should know that  `cars bring  money , lots of cars bring lots of money` . For example in turkey in 1960s we did not have enough cars and roads too, for transportation.People who wanted to go an other place, had to think twice. Afterward when our goverment made roads and decreased the taxes, our citizen had a car . Now, cars are everwhere .Our Goverment earn lots of money for cars roads and other things , and always try to use this advantages . it have not improved the train road and other.. cars still have brougt money to our county and other example is that cars is a big industry for the world and they always improve their technology and their thinking , always we have a new which have new properties and another .. ad cars are used for the apperace by human to human .. we have los                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10972  Nowadays it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Is it true or not? To come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today. At the past before the technological improvements there were lots of things which a humanbeing was not able to do alone. For example think about not having any washingmachine. When we think about the times that the female humanbeing must be doing all the houseworks. At these times families are much more crowded and as a result people have to wash much more clothes. Washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a women, all the other young people has to help their mother to have clean clothes. But now almost all of us have washingmachines in our house. When somebody in the family have dirty clothes he\\she don't have to call anybody. He\\she puts clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready.Year by year the population of the world is increasing. There not too much places to work and earn money. At the sum people prefer having small families such as parents and one child to have good life conditions according to their money. At the old times people were usually making farm work. When you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you, the more product you will have.Because of that people used to prefer having crowded families. And when a child has brothers and sisters it has to be social and help the others to have something to eat, to earn money or to have clothes to wear.Finally by the improvement of technology, life is much more easier but technology makes youngsters selfish. Young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "10973  I think that having a board knowledge of many academic subjects is not what our era necessitates. In our times, it seems to be more important, and more awaited to be a real expert on one specific subject. This thought of mine has many reasonings behind it.First of all, I don't think that a broad knowledge on many subjects could be useful, as long as with such a knowledge one cannot be really comfortable with all of those subjects, on which he claims to have a knowledge, and with knowing a little from everything, it is really easy to get confused when you study, or prepare a project. Actually, that is why teamwork is important in business life. Since a project cannot be prepared by one person, it is distributed among a group according to the specializations of members of that group. Thus specialization is favoured in industry.Secondly, I do not think that such a broad knowledge is needed in industry, though specialization in one field is necessary to have a succesful career. Since  at our level of technology everything is hidden in details, and thoughts that make differences are at minor scale, one should be able to observe the subject, and problem that he is working on with all aspects. According to my opinion, an understanding that through, and detailed is only possible with high level of specialisation. Thirdly, a broad acedemic knowledge means that person works on very many, and irrelevant topics. Yes, with such a working style you are working on a wide range of subjects, and you are continuously changing your study topic, and you know some of everything, and you seem to be successful with a lot of work fields you have, but you lack one, and a very important thing: Experience. Experince is, maybe, the most wanted speciality of a person, that is to be in high levels of his career. It had become to this that, experience is the key to a succesful business life. And i do not think that a broad academic knowledge distracts one`s focus, thus gaining experience is harder with that kind of knowledge, than the case with a specialisation field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "10974  the age is not the basic thing when the topic ic enjoying life. if a person is optimistic in his nature whatever his age is he can not enjoy life. young people have more energy to live and willingness to do things about life. but it does not show that they enjoy life more. most of the old poeple are smiling more than young people. especially in the last 10 or 20 years most of the young people have lost their energy to live. they are more depressive and optimistic than earlier generations. they do not satisfy from anything they get. they always want more and more. earlier generations know to satify with the things they have. and they could be happy even by a small surprise. it is because the new era we live in which directs us to consume everything we see and have. so our children does not know how to be happy and how to enjoy life. they spend their energy to consume only. by this situation we can say that our older people enjoy life more. when you look around yourself you will see that in the places where nature fresh air the proof of life stands there are older people more then younger ones. younger people are the shopping malls cinemasor at the take aways. so how can we say that they know how to enjoy life. they even do not know the source of life the mother earth. they only see things on tv. they do not speak and smile much. they thought they are cool and carismatic by not smiling. but enjoying life is smiling laughing. younger people do not curious about thing around them. they got used to consume the things given to them. but you have to be curious about life to be able to enjoy it.in conclusion may be we can say that 20 years ago younger people enjoy life more but not nowadays and it does not seem they will in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "10976  It is hard for me to choose on whether learning  the ideas and concepts are more important than learning the facts. The two concepts given are kind of completing each other so choosing one and leaving one out would create problems. Still I would say that when starting to work on a new subject or issue it is really important to first understand the concepts and ideas because without them it is worthless to learn facts that you would not have something to base the new information and the new ideas given  or tought to you.  As a metaphor  I might say that the ideas and the concepts can be seen as the cement and the new facts can be the new rooms being decorated in an apartment that was built with that cement.Leading from this metaphor still I can say that the facts so the rooms are important too because without them why would you build an apartment?As a student what I generally do is that, firstly I start and try to understand the deep concepts and ideas then I work on with the fact which help me to understand more in a much deeper way and the most important thing with the concept and idea part is that they are most effective tool for me to analyze the facts offered and given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10977  Nowadays , companies in the growing competitive environment  have started to focus on more effective advertisement techniques. To present their products better they have begun to show a lot of aspects of their  products.While some people claim that by doing that companies are overpresenting the quality or the purpose of their products, some people think that companies try  to show product`s features as close as possible to the reality. In the improved industrial societies , i don`t think advertisements would make products seem much better that they really are for the following reasons.        First , the main purpose of the advertisement is to sell the product. However , today there is something called customer satisfaction in the corporate world. If the customer percevies the product of much better quality. Then, as he uses the product, if he can`t get the quality that he was expecting ,the first  to suffer from that would be the company. Therefore , in todays competitive corporate world, i don`t think  any company would take the risk of losing the customers. Moreover, the improved and new consumer protection laws prevent the companies from frauding the customer by penalizing those actions.According to the law, company that provides the product or service should inform the consumer fully before entering into sales contract or transaction.        To conclude,  main idea of the advertising is to make the product attractive but not  seem  better than they are. Not only the increased protection of consumers by laws , but also the increased competition among companies over the market share by raising the customer satisfaction and having loyal customers will prevent the companies to make their products look better than they really are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "10978  Since the serial manifacturing of cars, they had become a really important part of human lives, as they decreased the time required for transportation. As people's needs for transportation will not decrease, it is really hard to say that there will be fewer cars in the near future. People use cars in their everyday lives and, for people today, it is hard to imagine any period of time without cars. There had been other forms of transportation in the past, but; none has been used as frequently as modern cars. One could claim that a newer form of transport may evolve. Some people even say that, we may be able to teleport in the near future, however; this suggestion has yet only lived in science fiction books. Therefore, in the near future, as near as twenty years, people are unlikely to see a newer form of invention that will close the era of modern cars. Cars' looks, types of fuel they use or their engine systems may change, but; after all, they will still be cars. Even if cars began not to move on four wheels, but; instead, started to fly; as we see in science fiction movies like \"Back To The Future\", they would still be called \"cars\". That is because, they will still be belonging to an individual and be used just like the way we use them today. As stated before, their way of working, that is; their engine system, ignition type, fuels etc. may change; however, they will still be \"the personal transportation device\".As a result, when we look at the 20th and the beginning of 21st century, it is almost impossible to see cars vanish from the market all of a sudden. Lots of people are happy with this as well, as long as oil prices are kept at a reasonable price. Maybe, the 22nd century will become free of cars and car addicts would surely be glad that they are not to see those times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "10979  \"It is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts\". I disagree about this statement. When I was child really I could agree above the statement. But now everything changed. In our time students want to learn reality.Students especially nowadays can learn a lot different subject from different sources. These sources can be internet or television. And also foreign countries television can be watched fron students and they can see different point of views. Also some countries they can learn real history of their countries and war reasons. After that at class Students can ask teacher some questions about fact. Before this was not, when teacher whatever  says students can take this idea or concept. For example before I learnt from my teacher about First World War, according to his statements;  we lost the war because our alliens lost. But now I learnt the facts from different sources especially foreign sources everything is different. All my ideas and concepts confused. Globalization started in the world. After globalization lectures , teachers or speakers any meetings or any speaking places must pay attention every sentence. Students now can questioned every word and every idea. Therefore, giving lectures all the time should developed their knowledges. Students can make for searching because of much spare time.

       "10980  Travel is the most popular way to escape from ur busy life,ur busy work and from noisy of ur crowded city. Some people would like to do it as a group, some of people like to do it by themself or just with a partner. There is a lot of tour company give you  a lot of options and benefits to travel. Tour guide would be the best and the most enjoyable way to travel as a group.If you decided to travel, first; you ask where we should go? second; which palace is the best to stay? third; what we could do over there? if you really dont know where excetly you are going to,you would ask this questions to yourself. By tour guide you have a lot of oppurtunity to chose where you will go and where to stay and what to do. If you decided to go to some historical places to see, the tour guide would be the best guide for group. Because they know everything about that places, they know how to get there where should be seen, what is the whole story about that historical place.if you dont have a guide you should get a book about that places and start to read it.it is not exciting as the tour guide telling you about the story. they also play like in that time and imitate the people who placed in the story. people in the group think about that story and they like it more than they read a book about it.when i came to United State in my first time i joint a group with my friend.threre was a tour guide leading to the group. it was very exciting for me,because the tour guide had wear like the old people in that time and he was explaning to us what we see and what the story is. i remembered a historical place where i went in my country,there was no one to tell us about history of that places,it wasnt exciting like the one i had in the U.S. it is the best travel to lead by a tour guiede.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "10981  It is important to do your job well. However, most people can do this by working hard and doing their jobs on time so they become successful. To create a differance from these people who are only working hard and wasting time by only obeying the comments of upper statues, what can you do? The thing that you can do, can be trying new things and taking risks.  First of all, trying new things shows the creavity. That means you do not only taking the information, you also analyse it and try to give a new proposal or product. It gives a different value to the job. For instance, if there are two managers that one is only trys to keep the work contunious and the other one also doing his job well but he also wants to increase next year`s bugget by changing his work princible that may be increasing the money that spent for the researchs or entering an area that has not been exist yet. Doing things that are different than what you do every day can increase your point. Secondly, in order to be creative, you should take some risks. The things that you do may cause a diseaster but they also give good results. If you do not try, you can never answer this question. Taking risks after analysing the situation do not seem horrible. At the end, more success and money can be riched. Therefore, when we compare the events, the results are like this:If you do not take any risk, you seem stationary that will be all right for someone. However, if you take risk and get a good result, you show improvement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "10982  I don`t agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do, i believe the opposite statement which expresses that older people enjoy life more than younger people do.Because i believe there are several reasons that prevent youngers to be more effective in their own lives which can be based on the fact that the young people should spend much time by studying for exams or by having stress because of the uncertainity of what they will confront in their future. Time that passes too fast,  has a strong pressure on youngers which prevents to enjoy from their lives.But when we think of a 60 year old adult who had earned enough money till that age of her life and prepared a good opportunity to be able to supply a good education to their children, has her peace and she has no more challenges with life any longer. Therefore, she has a huge time to have fun, and nothing to loose except money.Besides, because of the fact that time passes so fast, a 60 year old adult doesn`t think of anything else except having a great time till her death. As the person feels that death is sooner coming, there won`t be any other struggles or any fights with life whatever the reason is.As i give my mother as an example, she is a typical retired teacher who has enough money to live, and has no responsibility for looking after a child. For that reason she feels free to live without thinking of any doubths or fears. She is going to trips with her friends and having great time with self satisfaction. She lives her own by the power of not having huge responsibilities such as earning money or looking after a child.Consequnetly i can express that when i look forward future, i would rather to be more older just in case to be able to be more effective in life, by not just trying to do what life requires and also to do things for myself either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are many reasons of this situation.            First of all, ideas and concepts are more important than facts in the exams. In general, the questions are about ideas and concepts. The teachers place them too much importance, they spent too much time about them in the classes and moreover they want too much knowledge from students about ideas and concepts in the exams. For example, in my exams the questions are generally related with the ideas and concepts rather than facts. Therefore, I work for the ideas and concepts much.            Another reason is that in education system in my country, it is not very necessary to know the facts . On the other hand, the education systems encourages the students to learn and understand ideas and concepts. Ideas and concepts have more pages than the facts in course textbooks and they are discussed in more detail than the concepts. Therefore, the students place a bigger importance on ideas and concepts than facts.            Understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding the facts for the students. To learn about the ideas and concepts can help students more in the exams and the education system also encourages students to learn them rather than learning the facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "10984  Lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for  manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads cannot change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative. A close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated.A main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated. The state decides about what can and can't be said in ads by  legislating about ads and competition. That makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits: An angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company. Since advertising companies are aware of that, they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for.Another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status doesn't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products, but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell. How many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts? The answer is none. And since most ads do not inform anyway, it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are.Perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product's quality is in most cases subjective. For instance, some people like onion soup while others hate it.  Some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it. So, one's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product. This subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive.In conclusion, the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons: State regulation, the advertisement's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "10985  I agree that most of the advertiesements are used to make products seem much netter than they really are. We can see many exaples of this phenomenon in our daily lives. Ads have been an inevitable component of the daily media, such as TVs, newspapers, radio, even along the wall of the subways we use to go work every day. the advertisments are continously trying to make us believe that some products are worth buying. By without even we got influenced by them, we by tons of equipment that we do not even need at all. A serious problem I see with the advertisements that they lack honesty most of the time. generally, those who prepare tyhe ads resort to tricks and misleading statements that show their products  better that they actually are. In the following, I will give my obsrevations on this issue. Firstly, I think that most ads try to show  a product different than what it actually is because there are many similar products of the same kind in the market. Therefore, advertisements use some lies to make their products distinguished among all its competitors. recently, I needed some cutting equipment forthe kitchen. In one of the examples, i saw a set of equipment which is told to be able decrease the time spent in the kitchen to half. The knife kit was shown to be able to form varuious structures to cut different vegetables. It was said to hae a mode for potatoe kneeling anothe mode for peeling carrots. having influenced by this, I ordered the specific set of knives. However, the result shocked me. What I bought turned out to be a simle set of knives bundled with some simpel plasic boxes. Obviously, I felt cheated.  this is an example how advertisements can be effective in showing things different than they truly are.Moreover, I think the technique of distorting the truth has become the unofficial definition of the advertisement. There are many examples to convince me to think so. Today, the advertisers use various techniques to show the products brighter than they are. They use television shows to `prove` the usefullness of the product. However, all those shows are set up previously. They consist of people just playing their roles to convince us on the merits of a product. Today, there are even some Tv channels just for this purpose. Advertising relies on exxagerating the positie sides of a product while suppressing the negative sides. An example is thebrochures of holiday resorts. Theyu always show high storey buildings with a big swimming poo in front. the scene is always bright with a smiing face in teh background. Once I have been decepted by the beauty of such a brochure to buya holiday program on seaside. however, what I ended up when I arrived the holiday resort was a disaster. thre was a pool, but it was not functioning. the picture on the brochure did not belong to the actual building. This was a very bad experince, which strenghtens my belief on the fact that advertiesements are used to make products seem much netter than they really are.As a conclusion, I agree that advertiemnts are used to sho the products better than they are. I think this is done in order to make a specific product distinguishable among other similar ones. Moreover, I believe that this approach has been the norm among the advertisers. Therefore, one should be very careful when making results based on ads. The results can be very disappointing, as it was the case for my kitchen tool or my disastrous summer holiday.   \n",
       "10986  Young People and CommunitiesIn our developing world many things being changed. Nowadays, young people do not spend their time for their comminications. I agree, that young people do not give enough time for the communities. I beleive that young people has some reasons for to not have enough time for communities.First of all, our world changing everday.Nowadays people need money to stay alive so it is sometimes hard to spend time to helping communities. Being a human brings more resposilities and hard work. Some young people working in part time job they do not only earn money but also they earn experience. For instance; I do not hate to spend time for my community on the contrary i love it. In fact, I am working in my business and studying in university so I do not have enough time for my community. World getting harder and harder each day to stay alive thats why young people spendign their time mostly to earn money.  Secondly, there is other reason which is effective on young people to not have time for comminity. In our world technology developes by day and day. After internet has been dicovered young people gets worse and worse cause of it pushes person to lonely life. I accept that internet makes our life easier while we loose our young generation to spend more time on internet instead of our communities.For example; I prefer to stay at home and surf on internet rather that to spend time in my community. In conclusion, I think, that young people have reasons to not spend their time in communties. I belive that young people will have more time to spend their time to helping their communities in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "10987  It seems to me that specialising on one subject is much more important than knowing many different subjects but not being specialize on any of them for many reasons. It is clear that having the knowledge of so many different academical subjects is really important thing. By this way, people may gain the speciality of looking at a subject from different point of views and expressing their opinions on many different areas, however expertising on an academical subject is much more important than knowing lost of thing without being specialised on any of them.In the first place, since the people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not be an expert for any of the acadecimcal issues that they know, always there will be someone who are better than them and nobody will require their knowledge about that academical issues. In my opinion, knowledge is to be used and to make it be used, you should know it very well. It is not possible to gain benefit from that knowledge if you just have some broad knowledge about it both economically and personally such as gaining people's appreciation. In the second place, the main motivation behind learning an academical issue is improving the current level of society. If someone do not have a deep knowledge on an academical issue, he cannot put something on account about that issue and cannot be a useful for his society. It seems to me that whatever someone do, he should do the best. In this context, if someone is not very good on a subject, people will not evalute them according to the other subjects that he know, both the society and themselves will not get a much benefit of their knowledge without being specialized on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "10988  Marketing is a very crucial area of interest for research and for investment in today's financial world. It is quite impossible for a person to ignore advertisements around for they are everywhere and that they are very impressive at pushing ideas into one's mind. How many times does it happen that you use a product and then you come to hate it every time you see it advertised. I believe it happens very often, because advertisements make products (or even services) seem much better that they really are in various ways. Either it doesn't look, taste, fell, etc. as expected, or there appears to be many unsatisfying aspects of it compared to a few innovative aspects which was advertised, or it becomes a short-term good product that had to be disposed.First of all, I believe the advertisements are made very professionally to make products look very fashionable, delicious, etc. Whether it is a new model of pair of jeans you see the gorgeus model wearing in the magazine or a burger someone eats so invitingly on TV... It is always the case that the jeans don't fit you when you try them on, or the burger is in pieces and has a strange unidentifiable sauce when you buy.Sometimes it is not a problem of looks that matters, problem becomes what is inside. A brand new technology gagdet you replaced your old one with - which we all happen to do often in this world of consumption - makes you miss that old technology. Apart from the new useful aspect that was was advertised, you struggle to make use of the product because you are always busy complaining and pointing out to people around you they never say everything in advertisements.The last case I always come accross is - although rare, at least as annoying as others - that the obtained product satisfies the owner in every way the advertisement said it would.

       "10989  Yes i believe that in twenty years there will be many different models of cars.Even now car deseigners had designed many interesting cars that havent published yet.In twenty years maybe ten we`ll be flying around , diving under water with our cars.The time destination will go less like now with the car it takes 5 hours or 6 ours (ofcourse if your fast and your car is good)to get ot Istanbul.In the future it`ll take 45 min with the car i hope.The technology increases more and more everyday in a scary way in every different  part(cars,airplanes.boats,phones)Im not even sure what going to happens maybe we`ll go to the space with our cars who knows......                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "10990  A person is a student for all of his\\her life because learning process continues in all life.A learned issue can be forgotten in a long time period.The fact that if the person know the main idea of the topic he\\she would not forget it easily.So I agree with the statement that express understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students  than it is for them to learn facts.I agree with the following statement because of several reasons.Firstly, when a student learns the idea or concept it is more stable because the main points are learned by understanding the idea.For example, in a math class a boy can forget about a formula.By using the prove method he could reach again the formula.So it shows that he get the idea-which means the prove method- and using the idea he reached the fact-the formula.Secondly, without understanding the ideas and concepts its hard for a student to learn facts.It is a weak way of learning.Actually it is named as memorizing.Memorized information can not last long.But the information which a student learn is neccessary for his\\her education life.For example, a memory of historic information can be forgetten in a several dayes.But if a student get the idea with a small practice he\\she would not forget it easily.On the other hand understanding ideas or concept is not enough sometimes.As an example you can know how to prove a formula but if you dont know the formula then your idea learning means nothing.As an conclusion understanding ideas or concepts is more important for student than learning facts.The learned information can be forgetten but the understood information will last longer/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "10991  There might be a group of people who do not work for their communities as well as there are people who work hard and show great effort to improve their communities. I agree with the fact that there are more people working hard for their communities than who do not care for them. Firstly, people who have the right moral attitudes and behaviours should be aware of the envoirment they live in. And they should always try to develop it for the better. I assume that our world have enough conscious people to do so. Therefore people may be able to leave a liveable world to their children and the others who come after them. However, they might be very busy with their careers and their lives, improving our envoirment and developing it must include one of their goals. Having a good life should not be the only thing they care for or rely on. Likewise they won't have better enough lives in an uncared community. They can't live without caring for one another. There are people that suffer from hungar and the wars that damage their homes. I see on tv that a great number of people are working to make the conditions better. They try to find them places to live, adopt the children who have anybody left and fund for their loss. Even for the people who do not take action at all, there are campaigns avaible everywhere. It is the easiest way for them who do not stand up from their chairs they sit and at the same time they would still be helpful.To sum up, if people consider the fact that this world is not only ourselves but everyone's who lives in it, they will probably be more helpful for their community and try to change it for the better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "10992  Nowadays cars are the most common transportaion vechiles for human race. The reasons for this fact are firstly cars are individualstic so you can use whenever you want. Secondly it can be faster than public transportation. Finally and absolutely cars are much more comfortable than any other vechiles.But what are going to happen to cars in future? I think in future the cars will be use less often than today. There are too many reasons for this opinion. For example in my country the number of cars are increasing but the roads can't be enough for this much cars and the drivers are exhausted about traffic jam so they start to think about getting rid of their cars and using public transport. Furthermore I think the biggest problem is gasoline prizes. They are getting higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy any. These are the socio-economic disadvantages of using cars.Also there are different possibilities to make cars less important and less usable. Technology is growing so fast and scientsit can make faster trains, faster planes and the stations and airports are becoming more comfortable places and the tickets for more comfortable transportation aren't as high as they were before. By this way using plane isn't a luxury anymore. Furthemore technology might make a flying cars like in science-fiction movies. i think this isn't a waiting for too much because 40 years ago automatically openning doors were utopia in books or movies but they are real and common now. So maybe someday we will travel by flying on ourselves not in planes.In conclusion by the developing of technology and the socio-economis difficulties of having cars makes us to find alternative ways to transport. Even now cars are very popular that doesn't mean that it will go on like that. New discoveries will make cars unpopular but this will take long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "10993  Understanding is the basis of learning. Manipulated knowledges forms the ideas and consepts. Ideas and consepts are reasons of the facts. Indeed learning facts without understanding theory behind them is useless. In addition learned ideas and concets are also  useless without relating with the facts. These two are connected to each other.Ideas and consepts are important on learning but without relating with real facts, teaching system constructs useless brains. Students sure need to understant the main theories behind the real events. Understanding main ideas give the ability of making  brain storms and ability to find  relations between knowledges. According to the student  psyhcology, when the ideas do not related with real examples, knowledges hung up in the air. For  instanece, I were giving extra physics lectures to my neigbours little boy. He always ask me to give real examples for the subjects. It is neccesary to inform students about ideas and make relations by facts.If consider the other option, teaching students the lectures based on facts. There should be many questions occur in their minds. Why, how, when...It is geting more and more difficult to answer all those questions by only informing them with facts. An instructor can not possibly teach about chemical lessons. Matter consist of atoms and atoms inhales electrons and protons. It is impossible to understant main scince theories with facts.To sum up, education can not be established on only ideas, theoris and concepts.

       "10995  \"If only had youth the wit, and old age the time,\" I heard once. The answer to the above-mentioned question is hidden within this magic sentence. Implying that young people, out of lack of experience, make a lot of mistakes and people old enough to become experienced do not have the time to use their experience fully, one has to conclude that the old people have no choice but to enjoy life more than the young ones. Young people have fun, live adventures, keep falling in and out of love, yes: all of this is true. Yet do they really know what they're doing? Are they even aware of how they're wasting the precious time they have? No. Only after they reach a certain age can they appreciate the value of experiences. Only after losing the opportunity of living the life they really want to live can they understand how valuable their past memories are and value the little time they have left to complete their unfinished businesses before they die. Do not mistake me, I am not at all implying that the elder have the energy to get up and go out and have fun in the exact  same way a young person can. I'm simply saying that whatever they do, even if it is the simplest thing to do like feeling the wind on one's skin or eating a homemade meal cooked by their wives, they do it with utmost intensity. After all, it's not the quantity that counts, but the quality.    One more reason I believe the older people enjoy life more than young people is because the young people, no matter how successful they have been that far, still have a life ahead of them, full of worries: Are they going to be successful? Are they going to be able to properly support a family? Older people, having lived through these worries, are past this episode of tension and are relieved. If they have grandchildren, for instance, they know that it is their biggest accomplishment. If they do not have grandchildren, on the other hand, they are aware that worrying will be useless for there's the chance has passed them. So all they have to worry about is enjoying the rest of what's left of their lives.  Examples and situations may vary with personalities and periods. Yet one thing stays the same, the fact that even though young people believe that they're enjoying life more than older people, it is the exact opposite. Therefore even though as a twenty one year old person myself, I tend to wish that I am enjoying life better than my seventy year old grandparents, their quality of enjoyment is much better than mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "10996  Being young or being older influence the decisions, personal characters and the way of life, as well. By statement the way of life, I refer not only type of living but also the enjoment of that life. Do young people enjoy life more than the elderly? I agree with that statement, because youngsters are more enegetic, not stessful about the future, and not reluctand to experince new things. On the other hand, due their valuable experinces, senior citizens could have chance to enjoy more than youth.Firstly, the younger people, due to very biological and hormonal feature of their bodies, are very enegetic, which could not be compared to energy of older people. Being energetic gives youngsters a chance to do too many things within very short periods of time. On the other hand, elderly even there are too many energetic old people, cannot due the same amount of things within the same period and also within the same quality.Secondly, young people do not worry to much about their prospective futures. Of course, they have some kind of concerns about their careers and study but it is better to think about the end of the life like somehow elderly do. It is more probable to the elderly to feel deppressive due to feeling old. Finally, younger people do not have any oppositions against living and experiencing new things, such as new tastes, new adventures and even new friends. In contrast, senior citizens generally prefer to live in peace rather than in adventures. They have more concerns to continiue the stablity of their lives, which makes them somehow conservative, as well.In addition, we should not forget that due to their valuable expereinces, elderly in some cases can enjoy the life more. For instance, their experinces allow them to know what to do in which time.I hold the view that younger people enjoy life better and more than elderly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "10997  I agree with the only first part of the statement which says that \"Successful people try new things and take risks\"  because this is the precondition for achievement in both business and personal life. However, I disagree with the rest  of the statement which emphasizes that the successful people do not simply do what they already know how to do well. In my opinion, these people can become successful by the help of the things that are already familiar with them. Now I would like to mention the basic ideas behind my contention. First of all, trying new things and taking risks require a high level of self confidence and this is one of the most significant characteristics that many successful people possess. Self-confidence enables them to apply new methods or take new decisions in their both professional and business lives. Moreover, being open to new developments or ideas widens the people's perceptions regarding the issues or concepts and so this brings the success. Furthermore,to take risks may at the same time lead to increase in chance for invention. In other words, it can be accepted as a way to be an inventor of something. On the other hand, all of these can not be possible without using the old knowledge. That is to say, a person can be more self-confident if he or she really trusts his or her own knowledge, experience and ability which had gained before. Most of the time, by relying on their already acquired skills, they are able to become successful. In addition to this, the experience gathered from previous tasks provides remarkable clues about the nature of the risks. By already predicting the results of the risks, many successful peopl decide to take a certain risk. In other words, while they take the risks and try new things, they also guarantee themselves. This generally becomes apparent in the case of the businessmen working for many years and knowing the inside of the business issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "10998  There have always been arguments or complains about the behaviours of young generations among the older generations, It is an historical attitude of human in all periods of time. So the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities looks like a cliche and I do not agree with it. There are some reasons for my argument.First, the statement seems to me like a cliche because when my mother is making such kind of complains, she says that her mother was also making similar complains to her. Furthermore I have read an article about this topic and it is stated that in the writings of ancient civilizations there were complains about younger generations. What i mean that, the reason of such statement is the fight between generations.Second, we have to look at what does it mean helping community? I thing it depends on the time. For example, in the time of Second World War, working in a hospital as a volunteer meant helping community. From another perspective, children of a farmer can help their father in field so they may at the same time be helpful for the comunity. However, for the time being, young people are able to contribute their society throug sitting before the computer for hours. The activity has change by the time by it has always been the young generations who come up with the new ideas that lead to developments.as a result, we are live in a global world the most important aspect of which is information revolution. Quality of work in many areas depends on brain force not on the muscle force. People can work in their home with their personal computer and achieve much more things then before in a short time. By the same token, young people are also follow these developments. They learn many realities of the world and develop ideas for their solution by searcing in Internet in a very short time. It is not necessary any more to participate some kind of socially responsible clups, be aware of realities of world and develop an attitude. There is short ways of doing everything including helping society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "10999  The humankind always should invent and use new products to be the modern person therefore using new products is an impotant aspect in humankind's life because it could harm the humankind.I personally don't agree with idea of making the product advertisements much better than they really are.These are my following reasons.First of all,The humankind always need to intelligent in different situations but not selling the bad product with a very nice advertisement to sell more than they plan to.All the people would like the product advertisements which are most of lie.For example,I have listened and watched to an advertisement of a new toothpaste that showing the new product as a very efficient thing for your mouth health.But when I had listened to the radio I have figured out that the new product is a just typical toothpaste that don't have any additional ingredients rather than the regular toothpastes.In my opinion Humankind should do more important things that could develop our generation rather than selling typical products with good advertisements.In addition to this,The humankind should'nt believe to the advertisements that are not lying on proofs,For example,A person wants to buy a shampoo that he has got used to but he sees a new product that is the half price of the shampoo he got used to,Wouldn't he just try out once because of the price no matter his or her budget is.In my opinion we all do try it once before we buy the product wer used to buy.This is a very efficient point that a lot of people have been missing or ignoring.Not only the money but also the power of it could do whatever the product owners do.For example,Have you ever seen an expensive new product in markets.The new products are always the products which are cheaper than a dozen.The last but at least is that the most important thing we should not ignore is education level of the people because of believing the new product's advertisements.It has been always a stereotype that the cheap new products have no difference with regular products.In my opinion if the humankind needs and wants to reach higher,they should educate the people rather than telling them lies about unnecessary product advertisements.Not only this generation or the next but also a lot of generation is going to live in this world.That's why we should start to change our attitudes to reach higher.I'm not telling that people should not do things such as these advertisements,They should do with in a circle of limits.All in all as I said before,Humankind have more important things than making advertisements for  new products to make them better than they really are with advertisements which could be the most efficient aspect to catch people's eye on.The long and short of it is that the humankind should be interested in more important things rather than advertisements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
